# FHIR Integration

This user guide provides instructions for integrating AI agents with a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) service to enable the retrieval of clinical notes. The sample code includes support for a `CLINICAL_NOTES_SOURCE` environment variable, which can be set to activate FHIR service integration. When this integration is enabled, a test FHIR service will be automatically deployed within your resource group, and sample patient data `patient_4` will be uploaded to the service. With this configuration, the deployed agents will retrieve clinical notes directly from the FHIR service rather than from blob storage, ensuring a more streamlined and standardized access to patient information. The guide also includes practical examples and configurations to help you connect agents to your own FHIR services.
