Patient ID,Initial Query,Possible Follow up
patient_4,"Based on the full clinical picture of patient_4â€”including stage, biomarkers, treatment response, and recent imagingâ€”generate a short report estimating prognosis and possible progression pathways.","What is the estimated prognosis for this patient based on current disease stage, treatment received, and molecular characteristics?"
patient_4,"Given the presence of a KRAS p.G12C mutation, what are the potential benefits and risks of transitioning to KRAS-directed treatment with adagrasib? How might this change the patient's prognosis?","Given the KRAS p.G12C mutation, what is the clinical evidence supporting use of KRAS inhibitors (e.g., adagrasib vs. sotorasib) in this context? Are there known resistance patterns or co-mutations (e.g., STK11, KEAP1) that affect efficacy?"
