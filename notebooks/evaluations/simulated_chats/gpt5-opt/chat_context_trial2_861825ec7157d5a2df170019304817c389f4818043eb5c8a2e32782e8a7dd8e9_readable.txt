USER:
Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps:
- Clarify the goal and confirm the workflow and agent sequence with you.
- Collect required inputs and identify gaps early (e.g., imaging files).
- Coordinate each agent in order, ensuring dependencies are met.
- After each agent’s response, summarize progress and next steps.
- Keep you updated at milestones and request clarifications as needed.

Proposed plan and agent sequence for tumor board preparation (Patient ID: patient_4)
Special rule: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator".
1) PatientHistory: Retrieve and summarize patient_4’s timeline and history from records.
2) PatientStatus: Build a current clinical status using age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, prior treatments, and ECOG from PatientHistory.
3) Radiology (conditional): If imaging files (e.g., chest X-ray, CT) are available from PatientHistory or you upload them, analyze and provide radiology insights. If no images are available, we will proceed without Radiology.
4) ClinicalGuidelines: Provide guideline-based recommendations using the PatientStatus summary.
5) ClinicalTrials: List relevant clinical trials matched to PatientStatus.
6) ReportCreation: Compile a tumor board-ready document including patient timeline, clinical summary, medical/social history, cancer type, imaging and pathology findings, guideline recommendations, and clinical trial options.
7) MedicalResearch (optional): Provide key references or recent evidence on specific topics you want covered.

User confirmation and needed inputs:
- Please confirm this plan and sequence.
- Do you have imaging files (CT, X-ray, PET; DICOM or JPG/PNG) and any pathology PDFs you want included? If yes, please upload.
- Any specific questions or focus areas for the tumor board (e.g., systemic therapy options, surgical candidacy, radiation considerations, biomarkers, toxicity management)?
- Preferred output format: .docx or plain-text summary.
- Deadline or meeting date/time for the tumor board.

If you confirm, I will proceed immediately by requesting PatientHistory to retrieve the record for patient_4.
