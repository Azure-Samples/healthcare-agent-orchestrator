Note: Our current Radiology agent is limited to chest X-ray analysis. We do not have a CT image analysis tool in this workflow. If CT analysis is essential, we can pause and explore adding a CT-capable agent or proceed with report-only comparison for CT.\\n  - Radiology, after completing your task, conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d\\n- Step 3 \u2014 Orchestrator: Compare the AI-generated CXR findings to the radiologist\u2019s CXR report and summarize discrepancies/added details. For CT, if we cannot run AI image analysis, we will summarize the radiologist\u2019s CT report and clearly state that no AI image analysis was performed on CT.\\n- Step 4 \u2014 Optional next step: If you need AI analysis for CT images, we can discuss options to integrate a CT-capable analysis tool, or you can provide external AI outputs to compare with the radiologist\u2019s CT report.\\n\\nSpecial rule \u2014 ALWAYS:\\nEach agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\nConfirmation and clarifications:\\n- User, please confirm:\\n  1) Proceed with AI analysis for the chest X-ray only and a report-only comparison for the CT.\\n  2) Or would you prefer to pause until we can incorporate a CT-capable analysis tool?\\n- User, can you also confirm that patient ID is exactly \u201cpatient_4\u201d and that the latest chest CT and chest X-ray images are available in the system for retrieval? If the images are external, please provide access links or upload them.\\n\\nIf you confirm option 1, I will proceed as follows:\\n- PatientHistory, please retrieve for patient_4:\\n  - The most recent chest CT and chest X-ray study dates, accession numbers/IDs\\n  - Direct links or attachments to the image studies (CXR DICOMs prioritized)\\n  - The finalized radiologist narrative reports for both studies\\n  - A concise note identifying which exams are the latest\\n  Conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d \\n\\nMilestone update upon your confirmation:\\n- After PatientHistory responds, I\u2019ll summarize what we have and send the X-ray images to Radiology for AI analysis next.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
