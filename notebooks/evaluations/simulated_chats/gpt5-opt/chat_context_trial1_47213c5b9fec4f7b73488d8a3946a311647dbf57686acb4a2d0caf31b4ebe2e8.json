Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Conclude your response with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n- Step 2: PatientStatus \u2014 Transform the PatientHistory data into a structured current status (age, primary site, histology, biomarkers, staging, ECOG, treatment history). Conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n- Step 3: Radiology \u2014 If you can provide imaging files (CT/MRI/PET/Chest X-ray) or official report PDFs, Radiology will add formal imaging insights. If no images are available, we will rely on the latest imaging findings extracted by PatientHistory. Conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n- Step 4: ClinicalTrials (optional but recommended for tumor board packets) \u2014 Use the PatientStatus to surface trial options relevant to patient_4. Conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n- Step 5: ReportCreation \u2014 Assemble a formatted Word document suitable for tumor board, incorporating the patient timeline, concise clinical summary, medical and social histories, cancer type, imaging findings, pathology/biomarkers, treatment history, and (if requested) clinical trials. Conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n\\nWhat I need from you to proceed:\\n- Please confirm the plan above so I can initiate Step 1.\\n- User, can you confirm that the patient ID is exactly \\\"patient_4\\\"?\\n- User, can you provide any available imaging files (DICOM or JPEG/PNG) and/or the most recent imaging reports (CT/MRI/PET/X-ray) for inclusion and Radiology review?\\n- User, do you have recent pathology/biomarker reports (PDF or text) you want included, or should we rely solely on what PatientHistory returns?\\n- User, would you like ClinicalTrials included in the Word document? If yes, I will run Steps 2 and 4 to incorporate trial options.\\n- User, any specific formatting preferences for the tumor board document (e.g., institutional template, logo, section order)?\\n\\nOnce you confirm, I\u2019ll begin with PatientHistory and provide a brief progress update after each agent completes their part.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
