Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n- Step 2: If images are available via links/attachments in the chart, I will route the latest CXR images to Radiology for AI image analysis. Note: Radiology can analyze chest X-ray images. It does not currently support CT image analysis.\\n- Step 3: For CT: We have two options. A) If you can provide AI-generated CT findings (from your imaging tool), I will compare those to the radiologist\u2019s CT report; or B) If no AI CT output is available, we will rely on the radiologist\u2019s CT report only and note that AI image analysis was not performed for CT.\\n- Step 4: I will synthesize a discrepancy/additional findings summary: comparing AI CXR findings vs. the radiologist\u2019s CXR report, and for CT, comparing the AI CT output (if provided) vs. the radiologist\u2019s CT report.\\n- Step 5: I will present a concise summary and offer next steps (e.g., exportable report) if desired.\\n\\nUser confirmation and required inputs:\\n- User, please confirm the plan above. Also, please provide:\\n  - The latest CXR images for patient_4 (DICOM files or a secure link). If already in the chart, indicate where to retrieve them.\\n  - The latest CT images for patient_4 (DICOM files or a secure link). Note: Our Radiology agent cannot analyze CT images; if you have AI-generated CT findings from your imaging tool, please provide that report/text.\\n  - The radiologist\u2019s reports for both the latest CT and CXR, if they are not already in the patient\u2019s chart accessible to PatientHistory.\\n  - Any specific regions or findings of interest you want emphasized during comparison.\\n\\nIf you confirm, I will proceed as follows:\\n- PatientHistory, please retrieve for patient_4: the most recent CXR and CT events, including dates, accession numbers if available, and the radiologist\u2019s finalized reports, plus any image links contained in the chart. Conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
