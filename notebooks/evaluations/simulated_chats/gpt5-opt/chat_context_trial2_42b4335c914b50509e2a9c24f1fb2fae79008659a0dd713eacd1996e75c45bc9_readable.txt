USER:
Generate a comprehensive diagnostic summary for Patient ID: patient_4 including biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, and latest imaging findings. Export the report as a formatted Word document for tumor board presentation.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps:
- Confirm the objective, outline the agent sequence, and request your approval.
- Collect the patient’s timeline and history details from PatientHistory.
- Derive a structured current status from PatientStatus using history details.
- Obtain or confirm latest imaging findings; involve Radiology only if image files are available.
- Compile all inputs into a formatted Word document via ReportCreation.
- Provide milestone updates after each agent’s contribution and ensure handoff back to me.

Plan and participation order:
1) PatientHistory: Retrieve and summarize the full timeline for patient_4, including staging details, biomarker status, treatment history, and any recorded imaging findings.
2) PatientStatus: Using the extracted data (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG), prepare a concise current status section.
3) Radiology: If you can provide the latest imaging files (CT/MRI/X-ray), Radiology will add imaging insights. If not, we will rely on the narrative imaging findings from the record without Radiology.
4) ReportCreation: Assemble a tumor-board-ready Word document including diagnostic summary, biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, and latest imaging findings.

Special rule:
Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Agents should conclude with: “back to you: Orchestrator”.

User confirmation and needed inputs:
- Please confirm that you approve this plan.
- If available, please upload or provide access to the latest imaging files (DICOM preferred; JPEG/PNG acceptable). If unavailable, we will use the most recent imaging report from the chart.
- Do you have a preference for receiving the Word document as a downloadable .docx file or as a base64-encoded .docx string?

On your confirmation, I will proceed:
- PatientHistory, please proceed with the full timeline for patient_4.
- Then PatientStatus, followed by Radiology (if images are supplied), and finally ReportCreation to generate the Word document.
