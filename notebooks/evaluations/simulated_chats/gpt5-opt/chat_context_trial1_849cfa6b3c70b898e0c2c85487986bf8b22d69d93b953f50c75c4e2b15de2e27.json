Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n2) Radiology: Use the provided images to analyze the latest CXR and, if supported by the available imaging tool, the latest CT. Provide structured AI findings. Each agent must end with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n3) Orchestrator: Compare the AI-generated findings with the official radiologist reports for the same studies and summarize discrepancies and any additional findings.\\n\\nUser confirmation and clarifications:\\n- User, please confirm the following so I can proceed:\\n  1) Patient ID is exactly \\\"patient_4\\\".\\n  2) For CT, do you want the latest chest CT specifically, or the latest CT of any body part?\\n  3) Are the images accessible via your imaging tool to the agents here? If yes, please provide links or confirm that PatientHistory can retrieve them. If you have direct image files or DICOM links, you can share them here.\\n- Note: Our Radiology agent is optimized for chest X-ray analysis and can provide radiology insights on CT if images are accessible; if CT analysis is restricted by the tool, we will rely on the official report for CT and focus AI analysis primarily on the CXR.\\n\\nIf this plan looks good, I will begin by asking PatientHistory to retrieve the latest imaging timeline and reports for patient_4.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
