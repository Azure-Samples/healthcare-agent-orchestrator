Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n- Step 2 \u2014 Radiology: Use the imaging tool to analyze the latest CT and CXR images and generate objective imaging findings. If multiple series are available for CT, specify which series were analyzed. Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n- Step 3 \u2014 Orchestrator: Compare the Radiology agent\u2019s AI-generated findings to the radiologist\u2019s report and summarize any discrepancies or additional findings; provide a concise, structured summary. Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\nUser, please confirm this plan. If confirmed, I\u2019ll proceed to Step 1.\\n\\nTo proceed, I need the following:\\n- The latest CT and CXR images for patient_4:\\n  - Preferred: DICOM studies (ZIP or secure link) or series URLs; acceptable alternatives: high-quality PNG/JPG for CXR and key CT series if DICOM is not available.\\n  - For CT: indicate body region (e.g., chest/abdomen/pelvis), contrast phase(s), and series to analyze if known.\\n- The radiologist\u2019s final signed report texts for those same studies (findings and impression).\\n- If you want us to fetch from your system:\\n  - Confirm we have permission and provide access method (PACS/EHR link or study UIDs, plus any required tokens/credentials).\\n  - Alternatively, confirm that PatientHistory can access patient_4 in your environment and retrieve the latest imaging and reports.\\n\\nOnce you provide the above or confirm access, I will start with PatientHistory.\\n\\nMilestone note: Pending your confirmation and inputs, no agents have been engaged yet. Next, PatientHistory will retrieve the study details and reports, then Radiology will analyze the images, after which I\u2019ll compile the discrepancy summary.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
