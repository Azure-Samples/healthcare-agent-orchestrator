I will provide the content and can also generate a downloadable .docx upon request.\\n- Step 5 \u2014 ClinicalGuidelines: Acknowledge readiness for guideline-based options if requested; will not provide recommendations unless you ask (to comply with your request and role limitations).\\n- Step 6 \u2014 ClinicalTrials: Note readiness to search for relevant trials based on the PatientStatus output if you want this included.\\n- Step 7 \u2014 MedicalResearch: Stand by for any targeted literature or background summaries if you want them appended.\\n\\nSpecial rule \u2014 ALWAYS:\\nEach agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator).
