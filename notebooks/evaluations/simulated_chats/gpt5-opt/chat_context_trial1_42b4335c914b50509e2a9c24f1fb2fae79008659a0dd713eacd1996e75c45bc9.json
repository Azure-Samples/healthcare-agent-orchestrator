Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\" after their response.\\n\\nUser confirmation and inputs:\\n- Please confirm that you want me to proceed with this plan for Patient ID: \\\"patient_4\\\".\\n- If available, please upload or share the latest imaging files (CT/MRI/X-ray) or PDFs of radiology reports so Radiology can provide detailed insights. Without images, we will rely on report text from the chart.\\n- Do you want the Word document to include a brief section on relevant clinical trials and key literature references? If yes, please confirm your preferred geographic region for trials (e.g., US only, EU, global).\\n- Do you have a tumor board template (institution-specific formatting) we should follow? If not, we will use a standard, professional layout.\\n- If any protected health information needs redaction beyond the patient ID, let me know.\\n\\nIf you confirm, I will proceed as follows:\\n- PatientHistory, please proceed with retrieving the structured timeline and history for patient_4, including any documented biomarker results, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, and verbatim excerpts or summaries of the latest imaging reports.
