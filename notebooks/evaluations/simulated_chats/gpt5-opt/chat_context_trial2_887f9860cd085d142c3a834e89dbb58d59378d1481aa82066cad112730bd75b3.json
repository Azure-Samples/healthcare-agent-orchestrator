Agents must conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n\\nUser, please confirm:\\n- Do you approve this plan?\\n- Can you confirm that we have permission to access the latest CT and CXR images and their radiologist reports for patient_4 via the PatientHistory agent? If not, please upload or provide direct links to the image files (DICOM or compatible) and the report texts.\\n\\nIf you approve, I will proceed as follows:\\n- PatientHistory, please proceed with retrieving for patient_4: the latest CT and CXR studies, corresponding image access (files/URLs) for the imaging tool, and the radiologist\u2019s report texts for each study.
