USER:
Given the presence of a KRAS p.G12C mutation, what are the potential benefits and risks of transitioning to KRAS-directed treatment with adagrasib? How might this change the patient's prognosis?

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps:
- Clarify your objective and confirm the workflow.
- Collect the required patient identifier and/or core clinical details.
- Orchestrate PatientHistory to retrieve the timeline, then PatientStatus to synthesize current status.
- Engage ClinicalGuidelines for benefits/risks and MedicalResearch for evidence context; involve ClinicalTrials if desired.
- Provide brief milestone updates after each agent’s contribution.
- Ensure each agent yields control back to me.
- Summarize consolidated findings and confirm next steps.

Plan and participation order:
- PatientHistory: Retrieve the patient’s timeline and key details using a patient ID.
- PatientStatus: Summarize current status (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).
- ClinicalGuidelines: Outline potential benefits and risks of KRAS-directed therapy with adagrasib, and discuss how it may influence prognosis based on the patient’s status.
- MedicalResearch: Provide an evidence-based overview of adagrasib (KRAS G12C) efficacy and safety from recent trials and real-world data, to contextualize benefits/risks and expected outcomes.
- ClinicalTrials: Identify relevant ongoing trials for KRAS G12C that may impact options.
- ReportCreation (optional): Compile a tumor board-ready document summarizing the above.
- Radiology (optional): If you have imaging to review, this agent can add radiology insights.

Special rule — ALWAYS:
Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: “back to you: Orchestrator” after their response.

Confirmation and needed information:
- User, to proceed on a patient-specific path, please provide a patient ID as a string (required for PatientHistory).
- If you do not have a patient ID, you can alternatively provide the core fields needed by PatientStatus:
  - Age
  - Primary site and histology (for example, lung adenocarcinoma)
  - Stage (and presence/absence of brain or liver metastases)
  - Biomarkers (KRAS G12C confirmed, plus PD-L1, STK11/KEAP1, others if available)
  - Treatment history (lines of therapy, agents used, responses, dates if possible)
  - ECOG performance status

Would you like us to proceed with this plan? If you confirm, I will:
1) Ask PatientHistory to pull the record using your patient ID, then
2) Have PatientStatus synthesize the clinical status, then
3) Send to ClinicalGuidelines to outline benefits/risks and prognosis considerations for adagrasib, and
4) Ask MedicalResearch for an evidence summary of adagrasib in KRAS G12C,
5) Optionally query ClinicalTrials for trial options.

If you prefer a general (non–patient-specific) evidence overview while we await details, I can immediately task MedicalResearch to provide that. Please confirm your preference and share the patient ID or the clinical details listed above.
