Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n- Step 1 \u2014 PatientHistory: First, I will ask PatientHistory what details they need to respond, then provide the patient ID \\\"patient_4\\\" to retrieve the structured timeline and history summary.\\n- Step 2 \u2014 PatientStatus: I will ask PatientStatus what they need; then, using data from PatientHistory, have them compile the current status (age, stage, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).\\n- Step 3 \u2014 Radiology: I will ask Radiology what they need; if imaging is available, we will share it. If not, we will rely on imaging reports from the history for the tumor board document.\\n- Step 4 \u2014 ClinicalGuidelines: I will ask ClinicalGuidelines what they need; with the PatientStatus summary, they can provide guideline-based options for the tumor board\u2019s consideration.\\n- Step 5 \u2014 ClinicalTrials: I will ask ClinicalTrials what they need; with the PatientStatus summary, they will identify relevant active trials.\\n- Step 6 \u2014 ReportCreation: I will ask ReportCreation what they need; then provide the timeline, clinical summary, social/medical history, imaging/pathology findings, guideline options, and trials to generate a tumor board-ready document draft.\\n- Step 7 \u2014 MedicalResearch: I will ask MedicalResearch what they need; with a user-provided topic or keywords, they can add focused background evidence for the board packet.\\n\\nUser, please confirm:\\n- Shall I proceed with this plan for patient_4?\\n- Do you want ClinicalGuidelines to include guideline-based options in the packet?\\n- Do you have imaging files to upload (CT scans, chest x-rays, PET/CT) for Radiology? If yes, please provide them; if not, we will use textual imaging reports from the history.\\n- Any specific research topics (e.g., a biomarker, therapy class, or post-progression strategy) you want MedicalResearch to include?\\n- Any institutional preferences or constraints (e.g., formulary limits, trial site availability) we should note?\\n\\nIf you confirm, I will begin with PatientHistory.\\n\\nMilestone preview:\\n- After PatientHistory returns the timeline, I will summarize progress and move to PatientStatus to build the current clinical snapshot.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
