Instruct each agent to conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d after their response.\\n\\nConfirmation and needed information:\\n- User, to proceed on a patient-specific path, please provide a patient ID as a string (required for PatientHistory).\\n- If you do not have a patient ID, you can alternatively provide the core fields needed by PatientStatus:\\n  - Age\\n  - Primary site and histology (for example, lung adenocarcinoma)\\n  - Stage (and presence/absence of brain or liver metastases)\\n  - Biomarkers (KRAS G12C confirmed, plus PD-L1, STK11/KEAP1, others if available)\\n  - Treatment history (lines of therapy, agents used, responses, dates if possible)\\n  - ECOG performance status\\n\\nWould you like us to proceed with this plan? If you confirm, I will:\\n1) Ask PatientHistory to pull the record using your patient ID, then\\n2) Have PatientStatus synthesize the clinical status, then\\n3) Send to ClinicalGuidelines to outline benefits/risks and prognosis considerations for adagrasib, and\\n4) Ask MedicalResearch for an evidence summary of adagrasib in KRAS G12C,\\n5) Optionally query ClinicalTrials for trial options.\\n\\nIf you prefer a general (non\u2013patient-specific) evidence overview while we await details, I can immediately task MedicalResearch to provide that. Please confirm your preference and share the patient ID or the clinical details listed above.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
