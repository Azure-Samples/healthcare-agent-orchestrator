Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n- Step 2: PatientStatus will synthesize a concise current status using age, primary site, histology, biomarkers, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, and ECOG (from PatientHistory).\\n- Step 3: Radiology will summarize the latest imaging findings. If you can provide actual image files (CT, MRI, PET, X-ray), Radiology will analyze them; otherwise, they will summarize from the latest imaging report(s) in PatientHistory and note the limitation of no direct image review.\\n- Step 4: ReportCreation will generate a formatted Word document suitable for tumor board, incorporating biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, latest imaging findings, timeline, and a concise clinical summary. We will also include placeholders for sections with missing data (e.g., social history or pathology specifics) if not available.\\n- Step 5: ClinicalGuidelines will acknowledge scope and refrain from providing treatment recommendations unless you request them explicitly.\\n- Step 6: ClinicalTrials will either provide a brief note offering to search for relevant trials based on the synthesized status or perform a targeted search if you want that included.\\n- Step 7: MedicalResearch will offer to compile key literature relevant to the case if you want that included.\\n\\nInformation needed from you before we begin:\\n- User, do you have any imaging files (CT/MRI/PET/X-ray) to upload for Radiology review? If not, we\u2019ll proceed using the latest imaging report from the chart.\\n- User, do you want ClinicalTrials and/or MedicalResearch sections included in the Word document?\\n- Optional preferences: desired file name for the Word document, and whether to include social history and comorbidities if present in the chart.\\n\\nPlease confirm:\\n- May we proceed with the above plan for patient_4?\\n- Confirm whether to include ClinicalTrials and MedicalResearch sections.\\n- Provide any imaging files if available, or confirm that we should use chart-reported findings only.\\n\\nOnce you confirm, I will start with PatientHistory.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
