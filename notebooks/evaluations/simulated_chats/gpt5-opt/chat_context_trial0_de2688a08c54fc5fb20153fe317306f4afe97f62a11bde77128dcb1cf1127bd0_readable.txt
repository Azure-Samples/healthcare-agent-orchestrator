USER:
Analyze the latest CT and CXR images for patient_4 using the imaging tool, compare AI-generated findings to the radiologistâ€™s report, and summarize any discrepancies or additional findings.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation checklist:
- Confirm scope, data needs, and participating agents
- Obtain the latest CT and CXR images and radiologist’s report for patient_4
- Have Radiology analyze available images to produce AI findings
- Compare AI findings with the radiologist’s report and summarize discrepancies/additions
- Provide milestone updates after each agent’s response
- Keep roles clear; no clinical recommendations
- Ensure each participating agent yields back to Orchestrator

Proposed plan and participation order:
1) PatientHistory: Retrieve patient_4’s latest CT and CXR imaging events, including dates, the official radiologist’s report text for each, and the image files or accessible links/identifiers. 
2) Radiology: Analyze the provided images to generate AI findings. Note: Prioritize CXR analysis; include CT insights if images are available and analyzable. 
3) Orchestrator: Compare AI-generated findings against the radiologist’s report and summarize discrepancies or additional findings.

Special rule — ALWAYS:
Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator" after their response.

User, please confirm this plan. If confirmed:
- PatientHistory, please proceed with retrieving for patient_id="patient_4": the latest CT and CXR imaging events, including study dates/times, body part/series, the full radiologist’s report text for each study, and the corresponding image files or links needed for analysis. Include any prior comparisons noted in the reports.
