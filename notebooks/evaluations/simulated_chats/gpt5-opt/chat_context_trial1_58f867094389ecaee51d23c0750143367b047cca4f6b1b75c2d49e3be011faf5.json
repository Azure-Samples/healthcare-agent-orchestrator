If multiple \u201clatest\u201d studies exist, capture the most recent by timestamp. Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator) by concluding with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n- Radiology: Confirm imaging analysis capabilities and input requirements; then analyze the provided CXR images (and CT if supported) using the imaging tool to generate AI findings.\\n- Orchestrator: Compare AI-generated findings to the radiologist\u2019s report(s) and summarize discrepancies or additional findings.\\n\\nUser, please confirm:\\n1) Do you approve this plan and sequence?\\n2) Can you provide direct access to the latest CT and CXR images for patient_4 (DICOM preferred; or diagnostic-quality JPEG/PNG) and the radiologist report texts? If not, do I have your authorization for PatientHistory to fetch them from the medical record?\\n3) For the \u201clatest CT,\u201d please specify the body region (e.g., chest CT vs chest/abdomen/pelvis) and confirm the study date/time if multiple were done recently.\\n4) Any particular areas of concern you want Radiology to focus on (e.g., new nodules, effusions, fractures, devices/lines, post-op changes)?\\n\\nMicro-update: Awaiting your confirmation and access details. Once confirmed, I will first ask Radiology to list their exact input requirements and confirm CT analysis capability; then I\u2019ll have PatientHistory fetch the studies and reports accordingly.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
