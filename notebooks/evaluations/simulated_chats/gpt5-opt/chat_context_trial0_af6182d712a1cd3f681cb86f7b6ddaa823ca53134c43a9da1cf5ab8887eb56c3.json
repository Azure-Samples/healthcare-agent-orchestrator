If you can share image files (DICOM/JPG/PDF), Radiology will analyze them; otherwise Radiology will note limitations and defer to the imaging report text.\\n- ClinicalGuidelines: Provide neutral, citation-style summaries of relevant diagnostic and staging guideline sections applicable to the case (no treatment recommendations).\\n- ClinicalTrials: Identify example trial categories that could be relevant given the current status (high-level, not prescriptive).\\n- MedicalResearch: Summarize key evidence related to the patient\u2019s biomarker profile and staging implications for tumor board context (non-directive).\\n- ReportCreation: Compile a formatted Word document for the tumor board, including the comprehensive diagnostic summary (biomarkers, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, latest imaging findings), plus structured sections ready for presentation.\\nSpecial rule: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\" after their response.\\n\\nUser confirmation and required inputs:\\n- Please confirm this plan. Once confirmed, I will start with PatientHistory.\\n- If available, please upload or provide:\\n  - Latest imaging files (CT/MRI/PET/Chest X-ray) or the full text of the imaging report, and the exam date.\\n  - Pathology report(s) with biomarker testing results (e.g., IHC, FISH, NGS panels).\\n  - Any known details not yet in our system: age, primary site, histology, stage at diagnosis, biomarker status, ECOG performance status, and detailed treatment history (agents, doses, dates, responses, toxicities).\\n  - Brief medical and social history (comorbidities, smoking status, relevant exposures), if you want them included in the Word document.\\n\\nIf you confirm, I will proceed as follows:\\n- Step 1: PatientHistory, please retrieve the comprehensive timeline and history for patient_4.\\n- Step 2: PatientStatus will generate the current status from the Step 1 output.\\n- Step 3: Radiology will analyze the latest imaging (or summarize limitations if images are unavailable).\\n- Step 4: ClinicalGuidelines will provide neutral guideline section summaries relevant to diagnosis/staging.\\n- Step 5: ClinicalTrials will list high-level, potentially relevant trial categories.\\n- Step 6: MedicalResearch will provide a brief evidence summary on key biomarkers and staging implications.\\n- Step 7: ReportCreation will assemble the tumor board Word document for download/use.\\n\\nPlease confirm the plan and share any files or details you can (especially the latest imaging and pathology reports).\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
