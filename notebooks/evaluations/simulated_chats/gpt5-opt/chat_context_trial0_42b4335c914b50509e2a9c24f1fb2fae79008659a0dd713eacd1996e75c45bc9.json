If any items are missing, I will request them from you.\\n3) ReportCreation: Produce a formatted Word document intended for tumor board, incorporating the patient timeline, clinical summary, medical history, social history, cancer type, imaging findings (CT/X-ray), pathology notes, and the documented treatment plan. Optionally, we can add a ClinicalTrials section if desired.\\n- Radiology: Only needed if you can provide actual imaging files for review. Otherwise we\u2019ll rely on the imaging findings documented in the history.\\nSpecial rule: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Agents will conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\nQuestions for you before we proceed:\\n- Would you like us to include a ClinicalTrials section in the report? If yes, we will engage the ClinicalTrials agent after PatientStatus.\\n- Do you have any imaging files (e.g., chest X-ray/CT) you want Radiology to analyze, or should we rely solely on the documented imaging findings?\\n- Any specific formatting requirements for the Word document (institution template, logo, section order), or should we use a standard tumor board layout?\\n- Delivery preference: a downloadable .docx (we can provide a base64-encoded .docx for you to save) or a cleanly structured document you can copy into Word?\\n- Should the report be de-identified, or include identifiers as present in the chart?\\n\\nPlease confirm this plan. Upon your confirmation, I will proceed by asking PatientHistory to retrieve the record for patient_4.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
