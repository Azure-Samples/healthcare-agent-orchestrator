If images are not provided, Radiology will state what is needed or summarize from imaging reports in the history.\\n- Step 4: ClinicalGuidelines summarizes guideline-aligned options based on PatientStatus.\\n- Step 5: ClinicalTrials identifies relevant trial options based on PatientStatus.\\n- Step 6: MedicalResearch provides a brief evidence summary on a focused topic (e.g., first-line/next-line standards, key biomarkers, or new approvals); we\u2019ll confirm the topic with you.\\n- Step 7: ReportCreation assembles a tumor board document (timeline, clinical summary, medical/social history, cancer type, imaging/pathology findings, current plan, guidelines, and trial options).\\n\\nSpecial rule \u2014 ALWAYS:\\nEach agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Agents will conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\nWhat I need from you to streamline this:\\n- Can you share any of the following if available?\\n  - Imaging files (DICOM) or links/reports (CT/MRI/PET, chest X-ray)\\n  - Pathology reports (biopsy/surgical), biomarker/molecular results\\n  - Most recent labs and ECOG performance status\\n  - Any known treatment intent (curative vs palliative) and patient preferences\\n- For MedicalResearch, do you have a preferred focus area (e.g., adjuvant therapy evidence, targeted therapy data for a specific mutation, toxicity management)?\\n\\nPlease confirm the plan. With your confirmation, I will proceed to Step 1.\\n\\nIf you confirm now, I will start with:\\n- PatientHistory, please retrieve the timeline and concise history for patient_id = \\\"patient_4\\\".
