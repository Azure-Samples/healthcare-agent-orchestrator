Output: concise timeline and history summary.\\n- Step 2 \u2014 Radiology (conditional): If PatientHistory provides imaging files (e.g., chest X-ray) or links, Radiology will analyze and summarize the latest imaging findings. If no images are available, we will rely on the imaging impressions from PatientHistory.\\n- Step 3 \u2014 PatientStatus: Using the data from PatientHistory (and Radiology if applicable), compile the current status: age, primary site, histology, staging, biomarker status, ECOG performance status, and treatment to date.\\n- Step 4 \u2014 ReportCreation: Generate a formatted Word document suitable for tumor board presentation that includes the diagnostic summary (biomarkers, stage at diagnosis), treatment history, and latest imaging findings. If you want, we can include clinical trials or research highlights sections as add-ons.\\n- Optional \u2014 ClinicalTrials: If you want a clinical trials section in the report, we will have ClinicalTrials search based on the PatientStatus summary.\\n- Optional \u2014 MedicalResearch: If you want a brief literature snapshot (e.g., recent studies relevant to this patient\u2019s tumor type/biomarkers), we will ask MedicalResearch to provide it.\\n- Note on ClinicalGuidelines: To respect your request and our role limitation (no clinical recommendations), we will not invoke ClinicalGuidelines unless you explicitly want a non-prescriptive overview. We will avoid generating any treatment recommendations.\\n\\nSpecial rule \u2014 agent handoff:\\nEach agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent will conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\nUser confirmation and a couple of quick questions:\\n- Please confirm that this plan works for you.\\n- Do you want us to include an optional ClinicalTrials section and/or a brief MedicalResearch literature summary in the Word document?\\n- Do you have any imaging files (e.g., chest X-ray, CT) to upload for Radiology review? If not, we\u2019ll use the imaging impressions found in PatientHistory.\\n- If your tumor board has a preferred template or institutional header/logo for the Word document, let me know; otherwise we\u2019ll use a standard, clean format.\\n\\nIf you confirm, I will begin with Step 1 by asking PatientHistory to retrieve details for patient_id \\\"patient_4\\\".\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
