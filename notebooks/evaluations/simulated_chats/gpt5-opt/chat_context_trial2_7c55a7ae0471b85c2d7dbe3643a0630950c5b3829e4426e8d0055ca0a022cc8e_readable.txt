USER:
Identify and list active clinical trials that patient_4 is eligible for, based on tumor type, stage, KRAS mutation status, treatment history, and geographic location. Include trial phase and contact info.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps:
- Confirm the goal and outline a step-by-step plan with participating agents.
- Collect any missing inputs from you that are required for downstream agents (e.g., geographic location).
- Trigger PatientHistory to retrieve the patient’s record, then PatientStatus to synthesize current status.
- Engage ClinicalTrials to identify matching trials using the status and your location constraints.
- Provide milestone micro-updates after each agent’s response and coordinate handoffs.
- Summarize final outputs and offer optional next steps (e.g., report creation) without making clinical recommendations.

Plan and sequence (including the special rule):
- Step 1: PatientHistory retrieves and summarizes the full history for patient_4.
- Step 2: PatientStatus synthesizes the current status (tumor type, stage, KRAS status, prior treatments, ECOG, etc.).
- Step 3: ClinicalTrials lists active trials for which patient_4 is potentially eligible, including phase and contact info, filtered by your geographic location/travel radius.
- Special rule: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent will conclude with: “back to you: Orchestrator”.

Before we begin:
- User, please provide:
  - Patient_4’s geographic location (city, state/province, country).
  - Maximum travel distance or regions you’d like us to consider.
  - Whether you want all trial phases considered (I/II/III) or to limit to specific phases.
  - Any site-of-care preferences (e.g., academic centers only) if relevant.

If you confirm this plan and provide the above details, we will proceed as follows:
- I will ask PatientHistory to pull patient_4’s timeline.
- Then I will ask PatientStatus to produce the current status needed by ClinicalTrials.
- Finally, I will ask ClinicalTrials to return a list of active trials with phase and contact information that match tumor type, stage, KRAS mutation status, treatment history, and your location/travel preferences.

Please confirm the plan and share the location/travel details.
