USER:
Analyze the latest CT and CXR images for patient_4 using the imaging tool, compare AI-generated findings to the radiologistâ€™s report, and summarize any discrepancies or additional findings.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps:
- Clarify objectives, data sources, and access to required imaging and reports
- Confirm agent sequence and roles for this task
- Gather missing inputs each agent needs before they proceed
- Coordinate retrieval of the latest CT/CXR images and radiologist reports
- Orchestrate AI image analysis and comparison to the report
- Provide micro-updates at each handoff and summarize outcomes

Proposed plan and participation order:
- PatientHistory: Retrieve for patient_4 the latest CT and chest X-ray (CXR) study metadata, image access (DICOM links or diagnostic-quality files), and the corresponding radiologist reports. If multiple “latest” studies exist, capture the most recent by timestamp. Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator) by concluding with: “back to you: Orchestrator”.
- Radiology: Confirm imaging analysis capabilities and input requirements; then analyze the provided CXR images (and CT if supported) using the imaging tool to generate AI findings.
- Orchestrator: Compare AI-generated findings to the radiologist’s report(s) and summarize discrepancies or additional findings.

User, please confirm:
1) Do you approve this plan and sequence?
2) Can you provide direct access to the latest CT and CXR images for patient_4 (DICOM preferred; or diagnostic-quality JPEG/PNG) and the radiologist report texts? If not, do I have your authorization for PatientHistory to fetch them from the medical record?
3) For the “latest CT,” please specify the body region (e.g., chest CT vs chest/abdomen/pelvis) and confirm the study date/time if multiple were done recently.
4) Any particular areas of concern you want Radiology to focus on (e.g., new nodules, effusions, fractures, devices/lines, post-op changes)?

Micro-update: Awaiting your confirmation and access details. Once confirmed, I will first ask Radiology to list their exact input requirements and confirm CT analysis capability; then I’ll have PatientHistory fetch the studies and reports accordingly.
