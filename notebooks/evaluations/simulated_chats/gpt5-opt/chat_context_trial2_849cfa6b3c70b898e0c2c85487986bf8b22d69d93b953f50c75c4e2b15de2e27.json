Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n2) Radiology: Use the imaging tool to analyze the provided CT and CXR images. Produce structured AI-generated findings for each modality (noting image quality and any limitations). Each agent must end with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n3) Orchestrator: Compare the AI-generated findings to the radiologist\u2019s report, highlight concordant points, discrepancies, and any additional findings, and summarize in a concise format. If images are missing or inaccessible, I will request that you upload or grant access to the image files to proceed.\\n\\nUser, can you please:\\n- Confirm this plan and authorize access to patient_4\u2019s imaging records?\\n- Let me know if there are specific study dates to prioritize, or should we use the most recent CT and CXR available?\\n- If you already have the CT and CXR files or links, please provide them here (DICOM or high-quality JPEG/PNG for CXR; DICOM series for CT). If not, we\u2019ll attempt to fetch them via PatientHistory first.\\n\\nOnce you confirm, I will proceed in this order:\\n- PatientHistory, please proceed with retrieving the latest CT and CXR details for patient_4, including study dates, full radiologist report text (findings and impression), and direct image links/files if available.
