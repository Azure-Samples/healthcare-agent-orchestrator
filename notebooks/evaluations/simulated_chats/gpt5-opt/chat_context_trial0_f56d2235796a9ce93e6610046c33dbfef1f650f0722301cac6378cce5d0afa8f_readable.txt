Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps:
- Clarify the objective and propose a stepwise plan with agent participation order
- Confirm the plan with you and request any additional materials needed
- Coordinate PatientHistory to retrieve the record, then route outputs to dependent agents
- Manage handoffs between agents, prompting for missing information as needed
- Provide micro-updates after each agent’s contribution and keep you informed of next steps
- Ensure each agent yields back to me and that all agents contribute before final summary

Proposed plan and participation order:
- Step 1: PatientHistory retrieves the timeline and concise history for patient_4.
- Step 2: PatientStatus compiles current status (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG) from PatientHistory; we will ask you to fill any gaps.
- Step 3: Radiology reviews available imaging. If images are not provided, Radiology will state what is needed or summarize from imaging reports in the history.
- Step 4: ClinicalGuidelines summarizes guideline-aligned options based on PatientStatus.
- Step 5: ClinicalTrials identifies relevant trial options based on PatientStatus.
- Step 6: MedicalResearch provides a brief evidence summary on a focused topic (e.g., first-line/next-line standards, key biomarkers, or new approvals); we’ll confirm the topic with you.
- Step 7: ReportCreation assembles a tumor board document (timeline, clinical summary, medical/social history, cancer type, imaging/pathology findings, current plan, guidelines, and trial options).

Special rule — ALWAYS:
Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Agents will conclude with: “back to you: Orchestrator”.

What I need from you to streamline this:
- Can you share any of the following if available?
  - Imaging files (DICOM) or links/reports (CT/MRI/PET, chest X-ray)
  - Pathology reports (biopsy/surgical), biomarker/molecular results
  - Most recent labs and ECOG performance status
  - Any known treatment intent (curative vs palliative) and patient preferences
- For MedicalResearch, do you have a preferred focus area (e.g., adjuvant therapy evidence, targeted therapy data for a specific mutation, toxicity management)?

Please confirm the plan. With your confirmation, I will proceed to Step 1.

If you confirm now, I will start with:
- PatientHistory, please retrieve the timeline and concise history for patient_id = "patient_4". Remember to output per your JSON schema and end with “back to you: Orchestrator”.
