Agents, conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\nUser, to proceed, please confirm the plan and provide one of the following:\\n- Preferred: the patient ID as a string (required by PatientHistory).\\n- If no patient ID is available, please provide the minimum details PatientStatus needs:\\n  - Age:\\n  - Primary cancer site and histology (e.g., NSCLC, adenocarcinoma):\\n  - Stage (at diagnosis and current if different):\\n  - Biomarkers (confirm KRAS p.G12C; any others like PD-L1, EGFR, ALK, etc.):\\n  - Treatment history (systemic therapies, dates if possible):\\n  - ECOG performance status (0\u20134):\\n\\nOptional but helpful (for richer risk/benefit context and trial fit):\\n- Presence of brain metastases and recent imaging availability (CT/MRI/PET):\\n- Liver function status and any history of hepatotoxicity:\\n- Cardiac history including baseline QTc if known:\\n- Concomitant medications that might interact (e.g., strong CYP3A modulators):\\n- Any prior KRAS G12C inhibitor exposure (e.g., sotorasib) and response/tolerance.\\n\\nIf you confirm and supply the patient ID, I will start with PatientHistory.
