Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\" after their response.\\n\\n1) PatientHistory: Retrieve and summarize the complete timeline for patient_4, including diagnoses, staging at diagnosis (if charted), biomarkers, treatments, and imaging/report entries.\\n- What PatientHistory needs: patient ID as a string (provided: \\\"patient_4\\\").\\n- Output: JSON with patient_timeline and concise history_summary.\\n- Handoff: Provides source data for subsequent agents.\\n\\n2) PatientStatus: Synthesize a current status profile using PatientHistory data.\\n- What PatientStatus needs: age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG performance status (from PatientHistory output).\\n- Output: Structured status summary (stage at diagnosis and current, biomarker status, treatment history, ECOG).\\n\\n3) Radiology: Provide latest imaging findings.\\n- What Radiology needs: imaging files (DICOM) or the text of official imaging reports (CT/MRI/PET/CXR). If no images are supplied, Radiology will summarize the latest documented imaging findings from the PatientHistory timeline and clearly note that no images were available for direct review.\\n\\n4) ClinicalTrials: Identify relevant, currently recruiting trials based on PatientStatus.\\n- What ClinicalTrials needs: patient status from PatientStatus (cancer type, stage, biomarkers, prior therapies, ECOG, geography if available).\\n\\n5) ClinicalGuidelines: Offer non-patient-specific guideline references and option frameworks relevant to the case (no individualized treatment recommendations).\\n- What ClinicalGuidelines needs: patient status from PatientStatus.\\n- Note: To respect role limitations, this will be a high-level guideline citation/option framework only, not a treatment plan.\\n\\n6) MedicalResearch: Provide 3\u20135 key, recent references relevant to the patient\u2019s tumor type/biomarkers to append to the tumor board report.\\n- What MedicalResearch needs: topic keywords derived from PatientStatus (e.g., tumor type, stage, biomarkers).\\n\\n7) ReportCreation: Generate a formatted Word document for tumor board presentation.\\n- What ReportCreation needs: patient timeline, clinical summary, medical history, social history, cancer type, CT scan findings, X-ray findings, pathology findings, current documented plan (if present in chart), and clinical trials. If a treatment plan is not in the chart, we will include a \u201cTo be determined by tumor board\u201d section and an Appendix with guideline references and trials.\\n\\nMilestones and handoffs:\\n- After PatientHistory: I\u2019ll give a micro-update and pass data to PatientStatus.\\n- After PatientStatus: I\u2019ll give a micro-update and pass data to Radiology and ClinicalTrials.\\n- After Radiology and ClinicalTrials: I\u2019ll give a micro-update and pass context to ClinicalGuidelines and MedicalResearch.\\n- After ClinicalGuidelines and MedicalResearch: I\u2019ll give a micro-update and send everything to ReportCreation.\\n- After ReportCreation: I\u2019ll provide the Word document and a one-paragraph summary, then confirm if you need revisions.\\n\\nInformation I need from you to proceed\\n- Imaging: Please upload the latest imaging files (DICOM) and/or paste the official radiology report text for the most recent CT/MRI/PET/CXR. If unavailable, we will rely on chart-documented imaging findings only.\\n- Pathology/biomarkers: If you have the pathology report (including biomarkers like PD-L1, EGFR, ALK, KRAS, HER2, BRCA, MSI, etc.), please upload or paste.\\n- Performance status: ECOG (if known).\\n- Geography for trials: City/region or willing-to-travel radius for trial matching (optional but helpful).\\n- Data access: Do you authorize us to proceed using only whatever is available in your provided notes? If there is an EHR integration, please confirm we may retrieve data for patient_4; otherwise, paste/upload relevant notes.\\n\\nPlease confirm\\n- Do you approve this plan and sequence?\\n- Can you provide the requested imaging and pathology details, or should we proceed strictly from existing chart text via PatientHistory?\\nOnce you confirm, I will begin with PatientHistory for patient_4.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
