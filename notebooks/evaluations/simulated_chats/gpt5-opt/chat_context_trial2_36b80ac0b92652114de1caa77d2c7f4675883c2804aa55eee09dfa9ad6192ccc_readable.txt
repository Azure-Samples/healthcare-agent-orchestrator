Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps:
- Confirm objectives and align on the sequence of agent participation.
- Retrieve and validate the patient’s timeline and key clinical data.
- Generate a concise patient status summary for downstream agents.
- Gather/verify imaging and pathology inputs needed by Radiology and ReportCreation.
- Coordinate guideline-aligned options, trial matching, and research add-ons.
- Compile a tumor board-ready report and confirm any formatting preferences.

Plan and participation order:
- PatientHistory: Retrieve a structured timeline and concise history for patient_4.
- PatientStatus: Build a current oncologic status summary (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).
- Radiology: Provide imaging insights if images are available; otherwise note gaps and needed files.
- ClinicalGuidelines: Offer guideline-aligned therapeutic options based on PatientStatus.
- ClinicalTrials: Identify relevant trials matched to PatientStatus.
- ReportCreation: Assemble a tumor board-ready Word document with all sections (timeline, clinical summary, imaging/pathology findings, and plan/trials).
- MedicalResearch: Provide targeted literature related to a specified topic pertinent to the case.

Special rule — ALWAYS:
Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator" after their response.

User, please confirm this plan. Also, to streamline the process:
- Do you have any imaging to upload (CT/MRI/PET, chest X-ray, DICOM or JPEG/PDF)? If yes, please provide them for Radiology.
- Do you have the latest pathology report and molecular testing (biomarkers like PD-L1, MSI, NGS panel)? If available, please share or confirm they are in the record.
- Any specific research topic you want MedicalResearch to focus on (for example: “first-line therapy evidence for [cancer type] with [biomarker]”, “management of oligoprogression”, or “perioperative strategies”)?
- Any preferences for clinical trial filters (location, phase, sponsor) and the report format (template style, logo/header)?
- Target date/time of the tumor board and names/roles to include on the cover page?

If you confirm, I will proceed by instructing PatientHistory to retrieve patient_4’s timeline first. Micro-update on progress will follow each agent’s response.
