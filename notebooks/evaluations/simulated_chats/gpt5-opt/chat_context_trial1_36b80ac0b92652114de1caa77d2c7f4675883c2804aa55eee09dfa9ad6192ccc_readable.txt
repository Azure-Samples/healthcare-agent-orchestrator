Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps:
- Confirm your objectives and propose a step-by-step plan and agent order.
- Validate the patient ID and retrieve a concise timeline and history.
- Derive current clinical status from the history.
- Coordinate specialty inputs (radiology, guidelines, trials) and note any missing data.
- Compile a tumor board report draft and provide milestone updates throughout.
- Summarize collective outputs and check for any follow-ups or revisions.

Proposed plan and participation order to prepare the tumor board packet for Patient ID "patient_4":
- Step 1: PatientHistory will retrieve a structured timeline and concise history summary for patient_4. Output needed for all subsequent steps.
- Step 2: PatientStatus will extract the current clinical status (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG performance status) from the PatientHistory output.
- Step 3: Radiology will review imaging. If you can provide chest X-ray/CT/MRI images, Radiology will analyze them directly; otherwise, Radiology will acknowledge the absence of images and defer to summarized findings from notes.
- Step 4: ClinicalGuidelines will generate guideline-based options using the PatientStatus summary.
- Step 5: ClinicalTrials will identify relevant trials based on the PatientStatus summary.
- Step 6: MedicalResearch (optional) will summarize recent literature on a targeted topic relevant to this patient (e.g., the patient’s tumor subtype and stage).
- Step 7: ReportCreation will compile a tumor board-ready Word document incorporating: timeline, clinical summary, medical/social history, cancer type, imaging and pathology findings (from available data), guideline-based options, and trial options.

Special Rule — ALWAYS:
Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Agents: conclude with “back to you: Orchestrator” after your response.

Information and confirmations needed from you before we begin:
- Can you confirm we should proceed with this plan and agent order?
- Imaging: Do you have imaging files (CT, MRI, X-ray) to upload for Radiology? If not, we will proceed using summarized imaging findings from the chart only.
- Scope: Do you want the ClinicalGuidelines and ClinicalTrials sections included in the tumor board packet?
- Optional research: Would you like a MedicalResearch section (e.g., “latest evidence for [patient’s cancer type/stage/biomarker]”)?
- Formatting: Any site-specific template or should we generate a standard tumor board Word document?

Once you confirm, I will proceed with Step 1 and have PatientHistory retrieve the timeline for patient_4.
