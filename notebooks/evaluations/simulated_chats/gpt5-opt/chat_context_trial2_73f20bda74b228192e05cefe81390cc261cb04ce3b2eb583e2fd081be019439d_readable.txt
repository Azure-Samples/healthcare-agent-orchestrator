USER:
Can you scan all pathology and molecular testing to see if these biomarkers are present

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps:
- Clarify the goal and define the exact outputs you want.
- Collect required inputs (patient ID, tumor type, biomarker list or “scan all”) from you.
- Coordinate PatientHistory to retrieve all pathology and molecular testing entries.
- Compile and present a clear biomarker presence/absence summary with supporting details.
- Offer optional follow-ons (PatientStatus, ClinicalTrials, ReportCreation) based on your confirmation.
- Provide micro-updates after each step and ensure each agent yields back to me.

Proposed plan and participation order:
1) You provide inputs:
- Patient ID (required; must be a string).
- Primary cancer type and histology (optional but helpful).
- Biomarker list you want checked (or say “scan all available biomarkers”).
- Preference: most recent results only or full historical timeline.

2) PatientHistory retrieves and summarizes:
- All pathology and molecular testing reports for the patient.
- Extracted biomarker mentions with dates, specimen, assay/platform, thresholds/interpretation when available.
- Output: structured timeline entries plus a concise history summary.

3) Orchestrator compiles biomarker table:
- Present each biomarker with status (present/positive, absent/negative, indeterminate, not tested), date, source report, assay, and any cutoff/thresholds.

4) Optional next steps (only if you want):
- PatientStatus: integrate biomarker findings into a current clinical status snapshot.
- ClinicalTrials: search for trials matching the status/biomarkers.
- ReportCreation: assemble a concise tumor board–ready document with findings.
- ClinicalGuidelines: can generate treatment recommendations if requested; note I will moderate and not make clinical recommendations myself.
- Radiology/MedicalResearch: only if relevant to your goals.

Special rule — always specify:
Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Agents: conclude your response with: “back to you: Orchestrator”.

User confirmation and required details:
- User, can you provide me with:
  1) patient_id (as a string; required)
  2) primary cancer type and histology (e.g., lung adenocarcinoma, TNBC, CRC), if known
  3) the specific biomarkers you want checked (e.g., PD-L1, MSI/MMR, TMB, EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, KRAS, NRAS, HER2, NTRK, RET, METex14, BRCA1/2, PIK3CA, etc.), or confirm “scan all available biomarkers”
  4) preference for “latest results only” vs “all historical results”
  5) any specific cutoffs or reporting format you prefer (e.g., PD-L1 by CPS with threshold, MSI method, TMB units)

Once you confirm, I will:
- Ask PatientHistory to retrieve the full pathology/molecular corpus for that patient ID.
- Then I’ll compile and return a clear biomarker presence/absence summary with source details.

Micro-update upon your confirmation:
- I will trigger PatientHistory first and then report back before any optional steps.
