USER:
Can you scan all pathology and molecular testing to see if these biomarkers are present

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps:
- Clarify the user’s goal and define the exact output needed.
- Identify which agent(s) must be engaged and what inputs they require.
- Gather required inputs from the user and/or agents before proceeding.
- Coordinate the agent workflow, ensure handoffs, and provide micro-updates after each step.
- Validate outputs for completeness and alignment with the user’s request.
- Avoid clinical recommendations; focus on organizing and reporting information.

Plan and sequence:
- We will first engage PatientHistory to retrieve all available pathology and molecular testing information for the specified patient.
- Orchestrator will then extract and list the requested biomarkers, noting status (e.g., positive/negative/not tested/indeterminate), methods (e.g., IHC, FISH, NGS), and key metrics (e.g., TPS/CPS for PD-L1, VAF, MSI, TMB), as available in the records.
- If you wish, we can then proceed to PatientStatus to assemble a concise clinical status summary using the biomarkers found.
- Optional: We can later involve ClinicalTrials or ReportCreation if you want trial options summarized or a tumor board document.
Special rule: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Agents must conclude with: “back to you: Orchestrator”.

First, confirming agent input requirements:
- PatientHistory, please confirm what you need to retrieve all pathology and molecular testing for this patient.

PatientHistory:
- I require a valid patient_id provided as a string. If the patient_id is missing, empty, or not a string, I will return an error. Once provided, I will return a structured patient_timeline and a concise history_summary that includes pathology and molecular testing details. back to you: Orchestrator

Micro-update: PatientHistory has confirmed that a valid patient_id string is required to fetch the pathology/molecular data. Next, I will gather needed details from you.

User, to proceed, please provide:
- The patient ID (as a string).
- The list of biomarkers you want checked (“these biomarkers”). If you don’t have a list, I can scan all available reports and return every biomarker mentioned with its status.
- Scope preference: scan all historical reports, or only the most recent?
- Reporting preferences (optional): 
  - Include test methodology and thresholds (e.g., PD-L1 TPS/CPS, MSI method, TMB units)? 
  - Include genomic details like variant name, exon, VAF, copy number, fusions, and pathogenicity classification?
  - Note any dates for when results were obtained?

Upon your confirmation and providing the patient ID (and biomarker list if applicable), I will:
1) Ask PatientHistory to retrieve the records.
2) Extract and summarize the biomarker findings for you.
3) Provide a micro-update and propose optional next steps (e.g., PatientStatus, ClinicalTrials, or ReportCreation).

Please confirm this plan and share the patient_id and biomarker list (or tell me to scan and list all biomarkers found).
