USER:
Analyze the latest CT and CXR images for patient_4 using the imaging tool, compare AI-generated findings to the radiologistâ€™s report, and summarize any discrepancies or additional findings.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps:
- Clarify the objective, scope, and any tool/agent limitations.
- Confirm the workflow plan and participation order with you.
- Gather the necessary inputs from the appropriate agent(s).
- Coordinate image analysis and report retrieval.
- Synthesize comparisons, highlight discrepancies, and summarize findings.
- Provide micro-updates after each step and outline next actions.

Plan and participation order:
- Purpose: Retrieve the latest CT and CXR exams for patient_4, obtain the radiologist’s reports, run AI analysis on available images, and summarize discrepancies or additional findings between AI results and the radiologist’s interpretations.
- Order:
  1) PatientHistory: Retrieve the latest CT and CXR entries for patient_4, including exam dates, body region, accession numbers, image links/files, and full radiology report texts.
  2) Radiology: Perform AI analysis on the CXR images to generate structured findings. Note: This agent is limited to chest X-ray analysis and cannot analyze CT images in this environment.
  3) Orchestrator: Compare the AI CXR findings with the radiologist’s CXR report and summarize discrepancies/additional findings. For CT, I will summarize the radiologist’s CT report and note that AI image analysis of CT was not performed due to current tool limitations unless a CT-capable analysis tool is provided.
- Output: A clear summary of discrepancies and any additional AI-detected findings for CXR; a concise summary of the CT radiologist report with a note on AI-analysis limitations.
- Special rule — ALWAYS: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator" after their response.

Notes on tool/agent limitations:
- We can run AI analysis on CXR via the Radiology agent.
- We currently do not have an agent to analyze CT images. I can still retrieve and summarize the CT radiologist’s report and flag items for manual review.

User, please confirm:
- May I proceed with this plan for patient_4?
- If you have direct links or files for the latest CT and CXR images (especially CXR), please share them. If not, I will ask PatientHistory to provide access details.
- For CT: Do you want me to proceed with report-only comparison (no AI image analysis), or do you have a CT-capable tool/output you’d like me to include?

If confirmed, I will proceed as follows:
- PatientHistory, please retrieve for patient_4:
  - The latest CXR and CT exams, including:
    - Exam dates, body region, modality, accession numbers
    - Image file references/links suitable for analysis
    - Full radiologist report texts for each exam
  - Any prior relevant comparator studies noted in the reports
  - Return data in your required JSON schema
  - Conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

Micro-update after PatientHistory responds: I will summarize what imaging and reports are available and then send the CXR images to Radiology for AI analysis.
