If no images are available, we will proceed without Radiology.\\n4) ClinicalGuidelines: Provide guideline-based recommendations using the PatientStatus summary.\\n5) ClinicalTrials: List relevant clinical trials matched to PatientStatus.\\n6) ReportCreation: Compile a tumor board-ready document including patient timeline, clinical summary, medical/social history, cancer type, imaging and pathology findings, guideline recommendations, and clinical trial options.\\n7) MedicalResearch (optional): Provide key references or recent evidence on specific topics you want covered.\\n\\nUser confirmation and needed inputs:\\n- Please confirm this plan and sequence.\\n- Do you have imaging files (CT, X-ray, PET; DICOM or JPG/PNG) and any pathology PDFs you want included? If yes, please upload.\\n- Any specific questions or focus areas for the tumor board (e.g., systemic therapy options, surgical candidacy, radiation considerations, biomarkers, toxicity management)?\\n- Preferred output format: .docx or plain-text summary.\\n- Deadline or meeting date/time for the tumor board.\\n\\nIf you confirm, I will proceed immediately by requesting PatientHistory to retrieve the record for patient_4.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
