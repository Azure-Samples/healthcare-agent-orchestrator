Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). PatientHistory, please conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\\n\\n3) Orchestrator will scan the returned pathology/molecular results for the requested biomarkers and produce a concise presence/absence/indeterminate table with source citations (report name/date/method), plus any notes (e.g., variant nomenclature, VAF, amplification).\\n\\n4) Optional (only if you request):\\n- PatientStatus can compile a current-status summary focusing on known biomarkers and their most recent results. PatientStatus would also conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\\n- ReportCreation can generate a document summarizing the biomarker findings for tumor board use. ReportCreation would also conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\\n\\nUser confirmation needed:\\n- Please confirm this plan.\\n- User, can you provide:\\n  - The patient ID (string)?\\n  - The exact list of biomarkers you want us to check?\\n  - Preferences: include negative/indeterminate results? show all historical results or most recent only? include method (IHC/FISH/NGS/PCR), specimen type, dates, and quantitative details (e.g., PD-L1 TPS, TMB, VAF)?\\n  - If our system does not already have the pathology/molecular reports, can you upload or paste their content (even de-identified)?\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
