If any fields are missing, I will ask you to fill them in.\\n- Step 3: Radiology reviews imaging. If you can provide imaging files (CT/MRI/DICOM) or at least official radiology reports, Radiology will analyze them. If not available now, Radiology will specify what is needed and we will note this as pending in the report.\\n- Step 4: ClinicalGuidelines reviews the PatientStatus and provides guideline-based treatment considerations.\\n- Step 5: ClinicalTrials identifies suitable trials based on the PatientStatus and location preferences.\\n- Step 6: MedicalResearch provides a focused literature snapshot on 1\u20132 key topics most relevant to patient_4 (e.g., biomarkers or therapy class). You can set topic preferences.\\n- Step 7: ReportCreation compiles a tumor board-ready Word document including timeline, clinical summary, social/medical history, imaging and pathology findings, and consolidated plans/options including relevant trials.\\n\\nSpecial rule \u2014 ALWAYS:\\nEach agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\" after their response.\\n\\nUser confirmation and inputs:\\n- Please confirm this plan so I can begin with PatientHistory for patient_4.\\n- If available now, please provide:\\n  - Imaging: CT/MRI/PET or chest X-ray files (DICOM preferred) or official radiology reports\\n  - Latest pathology report and biomarker/molecular results (e.g., PD-L1, EGFR/ALK/ROS1, NGS panel)\\n  - Current ECOG performance status\\n  - Recent labs of note (CBC, CMP, organ function)\\n  - Any treatment preferences or constraints, and allergies\\n  - Location constraints for trial search (city/region you prefer)\\n  - Any specific MedicalResearch topics you want emphasized\\n\\nOn your confirmation, I will proceed:\\n- PatientHistory, please retrieve timeline for patient_4 (to be triggered after your go-ahead).\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
