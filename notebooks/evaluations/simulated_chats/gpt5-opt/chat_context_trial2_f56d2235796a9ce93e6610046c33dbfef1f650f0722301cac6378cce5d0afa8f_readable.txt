USER:
Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps:
- Clarify the objective and confirm the workflow with you.
- Sequence the relevant agents and state what each needs to proceed.
- Gather the patient’s timeline and derive a structured status snapshot.
- Coordinate imaging needs and address any missing data.
- Compile outputs into a tumor board–ready document and supporting materials.
- Provide milestone updates after each agent’s contribution and manage handoffs.

Proposed plan and participation order:
- Purpose: Prepare a complete tumor board packet for Patient ID: patient_4.
- Sequence:
  1) PatientHistory: Retrieve a structured timeline and concise summary using the provided patient ID.
  2) PatientStatus: Build a current status summary (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).
  3) Radiology: Provide radiology insights if imaging is available; otherwise specify what’s needed.
  4) ClinicalGuidelines: Provide guideline-based treatment recommendations informed by the PatientStatus summary.
  5) ClinicalTrials: Identify relevant trial options based on PatientStatus.
  6) MedicalResearch: Provide a brief literature overview tailored to the patient’s disease profile or specific questions.
  7) ReportCreation: Assemble a tumor board Word document including timeline, clinical summary, imaging and pathology findings, plan, and trials.
- Special rule — agent handoff:
  Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator" after their response.

User confirmation and needed inputs:
- User, please confirm that you want me to proceed with the above plan for patient_4.
- Optional but helpful:
  - Upload or confirm access to imaging (CT/MRI/PET, chest X-ray DICOMs or reports) for Radiology.
  - Latest pathology reports, biomarker/molecular results, and staging documentation.
  - Recent labs and ECOG performance status, if available.
  - Any institution-specific preferences for guidelines or clinical trial networks.
  - Any specific clinical questions you want addressed at the tumor board (e.g., resectability, systemic therapy options, trial suitability).

If you confirm, I will begin with PatientHistory for patient_4, then provide a short milestone update and proceed to the next agent.
