Agents, conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\nBefore proceeding, I need your confirmation and a couple of choices:\\n- User, do you confirm this plan and participation order?\\n- User, do you want ClinicalTrials information included in the tumor board document?\\n- User, do you have any imaging files (CT/MRI/PET/X-ray) to upload for Radiology review? If yes, please provide them. If no, we\u2019ll rely on the latest imaging findings from the chart text.\\n- User, any additional details you want emphasized (e.g., relevant social history, comorbidities, allergies) that may not be in the chart?\\n\\nIf you confirm, I will proceed immediately with Steps 1 and 2:\\n- PatientStatus, please explicitly list the exact fields you require to produce the current status for patient_4 so we can verify completeness before your step. Remember to end with \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n- PatientHistory, please retrieve and return the structured timeline and concise history summary for patient_4. Include any available: staging at diagnosis, primary site, histology, biomarker status, treatment history (with dates/lines), and latest imaging findings. Use your required JSON schema and end with \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
