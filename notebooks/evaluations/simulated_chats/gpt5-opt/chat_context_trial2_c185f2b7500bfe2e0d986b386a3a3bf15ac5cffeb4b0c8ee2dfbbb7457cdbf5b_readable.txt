USER:
Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps:
- Confirm the goal and outline the multi-agent plan and sequence.
- Validate required inputs and prompt agents to state what they need before proceeding.
- Coordinate data handoffs between agents to avoid gaps or duplication.
- Provide brief milestone updates after each agent’s turn.
- Maintain role boundaries (no clinical advice from me) and ensure each agent yields control back.
- Close with a concise summary and invite further questions or additions.

Proposed plan and participation order:
- Special Rule: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator"
- Step 1 — PatientHistory: First, I will ask PatientHistory what details they need to respond, then provide the patient ID "patient_4" to retrieve the structured timeline and history summary.
- Step 2 — PatientStatus: I will ask PatientStatus what they need; then, using data from PatientHistory, have them compile the current status (age, stage, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).
- Step 3 — Radiology: I will ask Radiology what they need; if imaging is available, we will share it. If not, we will rely on imaging reports from the history for the tumor board document.
- Step 4 — ClinicalGuidelines: I will ask ClinicalGuidelines what they need; with the PatientStatus summary, they can provide guideline-based options for the tumor board’s consideration.
- Step 5 — ClinicalTrials: I will ask ClinicalTrials what they need; with the PatientStatus summary, they will identify relevant active trials.
- Step 6 — ReportCreation: I will ask ReportCreation what they need; then provide the timeline, clinical summary, social/medical history, imaging/pathology findings, guideline options, and trials to generate a tumor board-ready document draft.
- Step 7 — MedicalResearch: I will ask MedicalResearch what they need; with a user-provided topic or keywords, they can add focused background evidence for the board packet.

User, please confirm:
- Shall I proceed with this plan for patient_4?
- Do you want ClinicalGuidelines to include guideline-based options in the packet?
- Do you have imaging files to upload (CT scans, chest x-rays, PET/CT) for Radiology? If yes, please provide them; if not, we will use textual imaging reports from the history.
- Any specific research topics (e.g., a biomarker, therapy class, or post-progression strategy) you want MedicalResearch to include?
- Any institutional preferences or constraints (e.g., formulary limits, trial site availability) we should note?

If you confirm, I will begin with PatientHistory.

Milestone preview:
- After PatientHistory returns the timeline, I will summarize progress and move to PatientStatus to build the current clinical snapshot.
