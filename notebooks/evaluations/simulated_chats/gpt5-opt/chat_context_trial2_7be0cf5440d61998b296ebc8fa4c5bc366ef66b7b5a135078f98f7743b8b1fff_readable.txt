USER:
Identify and list active clinical trials that patient_4 is eligible for, based on tumor type, stage, KRAS mutation status, treatment history, and geographic location. Include trial phase and contact info.

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps:
- Clarify objectives and define the agent participation order.
- Confirm required inputs and identify any missing details from the user.
- Engage PatientHistory to retrieve the patient’s timeline and biomarkers.
- Engage PatientStatus to assemble a concise clinical status for eligibility matching.
- Engage ClinicalTrials to identify active, eligible trials with phase and contact info.
- Provide micro-updates after each agent handoff and confirm next steps.

Proposed plan and participation order:
- PatientHistory: Retrieve patient_4’s timeline and key details (tumor type, stage, KRAS mutation status, treatment history, ECOG if available).
- PatientStatus: Compile a structured current status from the above (age, primary site, histology, staging, biomarkers including KRAS variant, treatment history, ECOG).
- ClinicalTrials: Use patient status plus geographic info to identify active eligible trials and return trial phase and contact details.

Special rule — ALWAYS:
Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Agents, please conclude with: “back to you: Orchestrator”

User, to proceed I need:
- Patient location for trial matching: city/state (or ZIP/postal code) and country.
- Max travel distance you’d consider (e.g., 25, 50, 100, 300+ miles or “no limit”).
- Phase preferences: include Phase 1 trials? (yes/no)
- Any site preferences or exclusions (e.g., academic centers only, exclude specific institutions).
- Date relevance: should we consider trials currently recruiting as of today, or a specific date?

If you confirm the plan, I will start immediately by asking PatientHistory to retrieve patient_4’s timeline while we await your location/travel preferences.
