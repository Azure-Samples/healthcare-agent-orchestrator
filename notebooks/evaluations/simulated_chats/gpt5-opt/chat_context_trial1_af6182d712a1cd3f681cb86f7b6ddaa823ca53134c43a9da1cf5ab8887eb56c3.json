Clinical trials can be included if you want them.\\n- Optional: ClinicalTrials can add trial options if you want that section. MedicalResearch can add citations or background on relevant biomarkers or staging if desired. ClinicalGuidelines is available but will not be used unless you explicitly request guidelines, given we must avoid providing treatment recommendations.\\nSpecial rule:\\n- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Agents, conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\nQuestions for you before we proceed:\\n- Do you want a Clinical Trials section included in the tumor board document? If yes, I will engage the ClinicalTrials agent after PatientStatus.\\n- Do you have any imaging files (e.g., chest X-ray, CT, MRI) to share for Radiology to analyze? If not, we\u2019ll use the latest imaging findings recorded in the patient history.\\n- Do you have a specific Word template, header/footer, or institutional formatting to apply? If yes, please provide details; otherwise I\u2019ll use a clean, professional tumor board layout.\\n- Any constraints on de-identification or distribution of the document?\\n\\nUser, please confirm the plan and answer the above questions. Once confirmed, I will start with PatientHistory for patient_4.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
