Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n- Step 2 \u2014 Orchestrator: Extract key elements from the timeline and pass them to PatientStatus.\\n- Step 3 \u2014 PatientStatus: Generate the current status, including age (if available), primary site, histology, biomarkers, staging, ECOG, and treatment summary. Then yield back.\\n- Step 4 \u2014 Orchestrator: Determine if clinical trials should be included. If yes, pass the PatientStatus summary to ClinicalTrials.\\n- Step 5 \u2014 ClinicalTrials (optional): Provide matched or relevant trials based on PatientStatus. Then yield back.\\n- Step 6 \u2014 Orchestrator: Assemble inputs for ReportCreation (timeline, clinical summary, medical/social history, cancer type, imaging and pathology findings, treatment plan to-date, and clinical trials if requested).\\n- Step 7 \u2014 ReportCreation: Generate a formatted Word document suitable for tumor board presentation and provide a downloadable file or link. Then yield back.\\n- Step 8 \u2014 Orchestrator: Provide a micro-summary and confirm if you need any adjustments.\\n\\nQuestions for you before we proceed:\\n- Would you like me to include currently available clinical trials in the report? If yes, I\u2019ll involve the ClinicalTrials agent.\\n- Do you have any imaging files (CT, MRI, PET/CT, X-ray) to upload for deeper radiology analysis? If not, I\u2019ll rely on the most recent imaging findings documented in the patient\u2019s timeline.\\n- Any formatting preferences for the Word document (e.g., institution header/logo, specific section order, or page limit)?\\n\\nPlease confirm this plan. Once confirmed, I will start with PatientHistory for patient_4.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
