Output per its JSON schema. Conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n2) PatientStatus: Using details from PatientHistory, generate a concise current status snapshot (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG). If any fields are missing, we will ask you to supply them. Conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n3) Radiology: Review the most recent imaging. If you can provide image files (DICOM) or official radiology reports, Radiology will extract definitive \u201clatest imaging findings.\u201d If images are unavailable, we\u2019ll rely on the imaging narratives from PatientHistory. Conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n4) ReportCreation: Compile a formatted Word document for tumor board presentation, incorporating patient timeline, clinical summary, medical/social history (if available), cancer type, imaging findings, pathology findings, and factual treatment history to date. If you want a Clinical Trials section included, we can optionally invoke ClinicalTrials after PatientStatus. Conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\nSpecial rule \u2014 ALWAYS:\\nEach agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Agents must conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\nWhat I need from you to proceed:\\n- Do you approve this plan and agent order?\\n- Do you want a Clinical Trials section included in the Word document?\\n- Can you provide the latest imaging assets? Options:\\n  - DICOM files (CT/MRI/PET-CT/X-ray) or a link\\n  - Official radiology report PDFs for the latest study\\n- If known, please provide:\\n  - ECOG performance status\\n  - Any institutional tumor board template or formatting preferences (e.g., logo, section order)\\n\\nUser, please confirm the plan and share any available files or details. Once confirmed, I will prompt PatientHistory to begin.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
