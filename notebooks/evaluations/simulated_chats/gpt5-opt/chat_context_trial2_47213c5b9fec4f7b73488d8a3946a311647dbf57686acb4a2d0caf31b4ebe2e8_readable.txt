USER:
Generate a comprehensive diagnostic summary for Patient ID: patient_4 including biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, and latest imaging findings. Export the report as a formatted Word document for tumor board presentation.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps:
- Confirm the plan and output needs with you
- Retrieve the patient’s timeline and history
- Determine availability of imaging data and extract latest imaging findings
- Compile current patient status from available data
- Generate a formatted Word document for tumor board presentation
- Provide milestone updates and coordinate agent handoffs

Proposed plan and participation order:
1) PatientHistory: Retrieve the full timeline and history for patient_4, including any documented biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, and imaging reports or image references.
2) Radiology: If actual chest X-ray images are available, analyze them and summarize findings. If no images are available, we will proceed using the imaging reports from PatientHistory.
3) PatientStatus: Summarize the current patient status (age, stage, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG) using data from PatientHistory.
4) ReportCreation: Generate a formatted Word document suitable for tumor board review, incorporating the timeline, clinical summary, medical/social history, cancer type, CT/X-ray findings, pathology findings, and treatment history.

Special rule:
Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: “back to you: Orchestrator”

User, please confirm:
- May I proceed with this plan for Patient ID: “patient_4”?
- Do you have any imaging files (e.g., chest X-ray) you’d like Radiology to analyze, or should we rely on the latest imaging report in the chart?
- Any preferences for the Word document (e.g., hospital letterhead, anonymization level, inclusion of images or only textual summaries)?
