Special rule: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n- PatientStatus: Synthesize a current status summary (age, primary site, histology, stage, KRAS p.G12C confirmation, PD-L1 and other biomarkers, prior treatments, ECOG) based on PatientHistory output. Special rule applies.\\n- MedicalResearch: Summarize current evidence on KRAS G12C-targeted therapies (e.g., sotorasib, adagrasib), chemo-immunotherapy combinations, and emerging trial drugs (next-gen KRAS G12C inhibitors and combinations), including efficacy data ranges, risk/AE profiles, resistance patterns, and general effects on prognosis by tumor type. Special rule applies.\\n- ClinicalTrials: Identify active/relevant trials for KRAS p.G12C aligned to the patient\u2019s status and geography preferences (if provided). Special rule applies.\\n- Optional agents:\\n  - Radiology: If chest X-ray/CT imaging is available and relevant to current assessment, Radiology can comment; otherwise they will note what\u2019s needed. Special rule applies.\\n  - ReportCreation: If you want a tumor board-ready document, this agent will compile all outputs once above steps are done. Special rule applies.\\n- Note: To comply with the role limitation, we will not invoke ClinicalGuidelines for specific treatment recommendations unless you explicitly request a general guideline overview without patient-specific directives.\\n\\nUser confirmation request:\\n- Please confirm that you\u2019d like us to proceed with this plan and order. Each agent will end their response with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\nDetails needed to proceed:\\n- User, can you confirm the patient ID exactly as a string: \\\"patient_4\\\"?\\n- User, can you provide (if known) any of the following to speed up the process: primary cancer type (e.g., NSCLC vs. colorectal vs. others), stage, histology, ECOG performance status, PD-L1 TPS (if NSCLC), other biomarkers (e.g., STK11/KEAP1, TP53, TMB, MSI/MMR), prior systemic therapies (chemo, IO, targeted), and any relevant comorbidities?\\n- Would you like us to include a ClinicalTrials search constrained to your region or preferred distance from a location? If yes, please share city/region or zip/postal code and whether to filter by phase (e.g., Phase 2/3).\\n- Do you have recent imaging you want Radiology to review (CT chest/abdomen/pelvis, PET/CT, or chest X-ray)? If yes, please provide images or confirm we should proceed without Radiology.\\n- Would you like a compiled Word document at the end (ReportCreation), or is an in-chat summary sufficient?\\n\\nNext step upon your confirmation:\\n- I will cue PatientHistory to retrieve the timeline for \\\"patient_4\\\". After their response, I\u2019ll provide a micro-update and pass to PatientStatus.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
