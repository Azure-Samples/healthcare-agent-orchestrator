Each agent will conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\nBefore we begin:\\n- User, please provide:\\n  - Patient_4\u2019s geographic location (city, state/province, country).\\n  - Maximum travel distance or regions you\u2019d like us to consider.\\n  - Whether you want all trial phases considered (I/II/III) or to limit to specific phases.\\n  - Any site-of-care preferences (e.g., academic centers only) if relevant.\\n\\nIf you confirm this plan and provide the above details, we will proceed as follows:\\n- I will ask PatientHistory to pull patient_4\u2019s timeline.\\n- Then I will ask PatientStatus to produce the current status needed by ClinicalTrials.\\n- Finally, I will ask ClinicalTrials to return a list of active trials with phase and contact information that match tumor type, stage, KRAS mutation status, treatment history, and your location/travel preferences.\\n\\nPlease confirm the plan and share the location/travel details.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
