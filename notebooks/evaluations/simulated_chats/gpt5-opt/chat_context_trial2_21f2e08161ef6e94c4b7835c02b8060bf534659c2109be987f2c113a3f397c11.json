Prior left supraclavicular nodal involvement noted at baseline. No charted hypermetabolic disease in abdomen/pelvis on 2020-08-04 PET; subsequent studies emphasize thoracic progression.\\n- Temporal trend: Initial robust metabolic/size response to chemoimmunotherapy (mid-2020) followed by slow increase in lingular mass size (2/15/2021 CT) and then clear metabolic and nodal progression by 3/22/2021 PET/CT while on maintenance pembrolizumab.\\n- Current disease characterization (latest PET/CT): 4.1 cm intensely FDG-avid left lung mass with progressive ipsilateral hilar/infrahilar nodes, consistent with active intrathoracic progression (M1a pattern historically noted with pleural invasion).\\n- Risk features (imaging-based): Central/lingular location with nodal progression raises risk for bronchial obstruction or post-obstructive phenomena if growth continues. Pleural involvement suggests risk of malignant effusion though none is explicitly reported in the latest note. Historic supraclavicular involvement implies a propensity for nodal spread.\\n- Limitations: This interpretation relies on chart-reported findings; no direct review of PET/CT images provided.

Next: MedicalResearch to add brief literature context on prognosis and progression pathways relevant to KRAS G12C metastatic NSCLC post chemoimmunotherapy.\\n\\nMedicalResearch:\\nRecent literature context (concise) for KRAS G12C\u2013mutated metastatic NSCLC, PD-L1 negative, post\u2013platinum chemoimmunotherapy:\\n- Prognosis with targeted KRAS G12C inhibition (contextual, not prescriptive): Phase 2/3 data with KRAS G12C inhibitors in previously treated NSCLC have shown objective response rates approximately 35\u201345%, median progression-free survival around 6\u20137 months, and median overall survival often around 12\u201314 months in intent-to-treat populations. Outcomes vary by prior lines, CNS involvement, and performance status.\\n- Common progression pathways on or after KRAS G12C inhibition:\\n  - Intrathoracic regrowth at the primary and nodal sites remains frequent.\\n  - New lesions in the lung, pleura, and lymph nodes; CNS events have been reported, with some agents demonstrating intracranial activity but CNS progression still occurs.\\n- Molecular resistance mechanisms (emerging data):\\n  - On-target KRAS secondary alterations (e.g., Y96D, G13, Q61 variants), KRAS amplification.\\n  - Bypass signaling via RTK pathway activation (e.g., MET amplification), ERBB family, or downstream MAPK/PI3K alterations.\\n  - Less frequent histologic transformation events.\\n- PD-L1-negative tumors generally derive less durable benefit from single-agent PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors; combined modality benefit is variable and influenced by tumor biology and TMB (not reported here).\\n\\nback to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nMicro-update: MedicalResearch added literature-based context on expected disease-control intervals post\u2013chemoimmunotherapy in KRAS G12C NSCLC and on common progression biology. Next: ReportCreation to generate a concise prognosis/progression-focused report (no ClinicalTrials section per your preference).\\n\\nReportCreation:\\nShort report: Prognosis estimate and possible progression pathways for patient_4\\n\\nPatient and disease overview:\\n- ID: patient_4; 59-year-old female; former smoker (~45 pack-years).\\n- Diagnosis: Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the left lung.\\n- Stage: IVA (T4N3M1a) with pleural involvement and multistation thoracic nodal disease.\\n- Molecular profile: KRAS p.G12C; PD-L1 negative; MSI/MMR and TMB not reported.\\n- ECOG performance status: 1.\\n\\nTreatment course and responses:\\n- 2020-04 to 2020-09: Platinum doublet plus pembrolizumab x6; best response partial response (PET/CT 8/4/2020 and 10/22/2020).\\n- 2020-12 to 2021-03: Maintenance pembrolizumab; progression documented on 3/22/2021 PET/CT with enlarging, intensely FDG-avid 4.1 cm left lung mass and progressive left hilar/infrahilar nodes.\\n\\nCurrent disease status (imaging highlights):\\n- 2/15/2021 CT: Lingular mass 3.6 x 2.5 cm; mixed nodal changes.\\n- 3/22/2021 PET/CT: Progressive intrathoracic disease\u2014dominant left lung mass and ipsilateral hilar/infrahilar nodal progression; no charted extrathoracic metastatic uptake at that time.\\n\\nPrognostic context (non-prescriptive):\\n- Factors associated with prognosis in this case include: ECOG 1 (favorable relative to higher scores), stage IV with pleural involvement and N3 nodal disease (adverse), PD-L1 negativity (adverse for maintenance IO durability), initial partial response to chemoimmunotherapy (favorable), and presence of a KRAS G12C driver (availability of targeted options may influence disease-control intervals after progression). Comorbid CAD and prior immune-related hypothyroidism are relevant to overall functional reserve and longitudinal management.\\n- Population-level expectations in contemporary stage IV NSCLC cohorts treated with platinum plus immunotherapy commonly show median overall survival on the order of 12\u201324 months, with substantial variability across individuals. In KRAS G12C\u2013mutated, previously treated populations, median progression-free intervals around 6\u20137 months and median overall survival around 12\u201314 months have been reported with targeted approaches; real-world outcomes depend on performance status, burden and sites of disease, and CNS involvement.\\n\\nLikely progression pathways to monitor:\\n- Intrathoracic:\\n  - Enlargement of the left lingular primary with potential for airway compromise/post-obstructive changes.\\n  - Progression of ipsilateral and contralateral mediastinal/hilar nodal disease.\\n  - Development of pleural nodularity or malignant pleural effusion (given M1a/pleural invasion).\\n  - New or enlarging pulmonary nodules, including contralateral lung.\\n- CNS:\\n  - Risk of brain metastases over time in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma; surveillance as per local practice is pertinent even after a previously negative MRI.\\n- Extrathoracic:\\n  - Potential later involvement of bone or liver, though current charted progression is intrathoracic.\\n- Molecular evolution/resistance:\\n  - Possible on-target KRAS alterations (e.g., secondary KRAS mutations or amplification) or bypass pathway activation (e.g., MET amplification, ERBB signaling), which may manifest radiographically as multifocal intrathoracic progression or emergence of new sites.\\n\\nNotes and sources:\\n- Key charted studies: PET/CT (8/4/2020 partial response; 10/22/2020 continued response; 3/22/2021 progression), CT chest (2/15/2021 interval changes). Diagnostic EBUS/FNA 3/30/2020 confirmed adenocarcinoma. Biomarkers per 8/10/2020 NGS report.\\n- ECOG and comorbidity details per oncology and cardiology notes in 2020\u20132021.\\n\\nback to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nMicro-update: All planned agents (excluding ClinicalTrials per your preference) have contributed. The report focuses on prognosis framing and plausible progression pathways, aligned with charted imaging trends and literature context.\\n\\nSynthesis: The collective inputs characterize patient_4 as KRAS G12C\u2013mutated, PD-L1\u2013negative stage IVA lung adenocarcinoma with good performance status, initial response to chemoimmunotherapy, and subsequent intrathoracic progression on maintenance immunotherapy; near-term progression risk is most prominent within the thorax (primary and nodal, with pleural involvement), with CNS and extrathoracic spread as ongoing considerations.\\n\\nWould you like any refinements to the report, inclusion of specific imaging excerpts, or addition of a ClinicalTrials overview? If you want to proceed with any follow-up tasks, I propose: 1) optionally re-engage Radiology for deeper comparison metrics if you can share imaging, 2) run ClinicalTrials if you opt in, and 3) have ReportCreation update the document accordingly.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
