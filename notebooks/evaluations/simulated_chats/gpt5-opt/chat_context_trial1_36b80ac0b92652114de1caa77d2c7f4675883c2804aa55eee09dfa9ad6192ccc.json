Output needed for all subsequent steps.\\n- Step 2: PatientStatus will extract the current clinical status (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG performance status) from the PatientHistory output.\\n- Step 3: Radiology will review imaging. If you can provide chest X-ray/CT/MRI images, Radiology will analyze them directly; otherwise, Radiology will acknowledge the absence of images and defer to summarized findings from notes.\\n- Step 4: ClinicalGuidelines will generate guideline-based options using the PatientStatus summary.\\n- Step 5: ClinicalTrials will identify relevant trials based on the PatientStatus summary.\\n- Step 6: MedicalResearch (optional) will summarize recent literature on a targeted topic relevant to this patient (e.g., the patient\u2019s tumor subtype and stage).\\n- Step 7: ReportCreation will compile a tumor board-ready Word document incorporating: timeline, clinical summary, medical/social history, cancer type, imaging and pathology findings (from available data), guideline-based options, and trial options.\\n\\nSpecial Rule \u2014 ALWAYS:\\nEach agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Agents: conclude with \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d after your response.\\n\\nInformation and confirmations needed from you before we begin:\\n- Can you confirm we should proceed with this plan and agent order?\\n- Imaging: Do you have imaging files (CT, MRI, X-ray) to upload for Radiology? If not, we will proceed using summarized imaging findings from the chart only.\\n- Scope: Do you want the ClinicalGuidelines and ClinicalTrials sections included in the tumor board packet?\\n- Optional research: Would you like a MedicalResearch section (e.g., \u201clatest evidence for [patient\u2019s cancer type/stage/biomarker]\u201d)?\\n- Formatting: Any site-specific template or should we generate a standard tumor board Word document?\\n\\nOnce you confirm, I will proceed with Step 1 and have PatientHistory retrieve the timeline for patient_4.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
