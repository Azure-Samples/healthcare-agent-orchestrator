Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps:
- Confirm scope, inputs, and user preferences; outline the workflow and agent order
- Collect the patient timeline and data foundation
- Synthesize current status and identify gaps
- Gather optional analyses (imaging, guidelines, trials) based on available data
- Compile the tumor board document and flag missing items for follow-up
- Provide milestone updates and next steps after each agent response

Proposed plan and participation order:
1) PatientHistory: Retrieve and summarize the full timeline for patient_4.
2) PatientStatus: Derive the current clinical status (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG) from PatientHistory.
3) Radiology: If you provide imaging files/reports (CT, chest X-ray), analyze and summarize key findings; otherwise we will use text reports from PatientHistory.
4) ClinicalGuidelines (optional): Provide guideline-based options informed by PatientStatus.
5) ClinicalTrials: Identify potential trial options using PatientStatus.
6) ReportCreation: Assemble a tumor board-ready document including timeline, clinical summary, medical/social history, cancer type, imaging findings, pathology, current plan, and clinical trials.
7) MedicalResearch (optional): If you have research questions or topics, we will pull targeted literature.

Special rule â€” agent handoff:
Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Agents, please conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator".

User, please confirm:
- May I proceed with this plan for patient_4?
- Do you want ClinicalGuidelines to include guideline-based options in the report?
- Do you have any imaging to upload (CT, chest X-ray) or radiology reports, and any pathology reports? If yes, please provide or specify where to retrieve them.
- Can you share any of the following if not already in the chart: ECOG performance status, known biomarkers (e.g., PD-L1, NGS panel), key comorbidities/allergies, prior systemic therapies with dates, and any specific clinical questions you want the tumor board to address?
- Any institution-specific template or formatting requirements for the tumor board document, and your deadline?

Once you confirm, I will begin with PatientHistory for patient_4 and provide a milestone update before moving to the next agent.
