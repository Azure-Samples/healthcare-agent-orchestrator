USER:
Identify and list active clinical trials that patient_4 is eligible for, based on tumor type, stage, KRAS mutation status, treatment history, and geographic location. Include trial phase and contact info.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps:
- Clarify the user goal and confirm required inputs.
- Propose a step-by-step plan with participating agents and what each will deliver.
- Collect missing details from the user (especially geographic location and any constraints).
- Sequentially engage agents, ensuring each returns needed outputs and yields back control.
- Provide brief progress updates after each agent’s response.
- Summarize results and offer next steps.

Proposed plan and participation order:
- PatientHistory: Retrieve patient_4’s timeline and key clinical details from records.
- PatientStatus: Summarize current status (age, tumor type, stage, histology, KRAS status, treatment history, ECOG).
- ClinicalTrials: Identify active, location-appropriate clinical trials that match patient_4’s tumor type, stage, KRAS mutation, and treatment history; include trial phase and site contact details.
Special rule: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent will conclude with: “back to you: Orchestrator”.

User, please confirm:
1) Confirm the patient ID is “patient_4”.
2) Provide the patient’s geographic preference for trial matching:
- Home base (city, state/province, country) and acceptable travel radius (e.g., 50 miles/80 km, statewide, nationwide, or specific countries).
- Any site preferences or restrictions (e.g., academic centers only, specific hospitals).
3) Optional but helpful: any recent changes not yet in the chart (e.g., new treatment since last note, updated ECOG, new biomarker results).

Once you confirm, I will proceed with PatientHistory for patient_4, then PatientStatus, then ClinicalTrials in that order.
