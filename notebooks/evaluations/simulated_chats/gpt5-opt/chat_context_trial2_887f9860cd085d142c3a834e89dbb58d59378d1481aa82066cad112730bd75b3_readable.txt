ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps:
- Clarify the goal and confirm the workflow with you.
- Identify which agents are needed and in what order.
- Gather the required imaging and report data from the appropriate agent(s).
- Have Radiology analyze the images using the imaging tool.
- Compare AI findings to the radiologist’s report and summarize discrepancies.
- Provide micro-updates after each step and outline the next action.

Plan and participation order:
1) PatientHistory: Retrieve the latest CT and CXR studies for patient_4, including:
- Study dates and body regions.
- Access to the images (files or links) suitable for the imaging tool.
- The official radiologist’s report text for each study.
2) Radiology: Use the imaging tool to analyze the provided CT and CXR images and generate AI findings for each study.
3) Orchestrator: Compare AI-generated findings to the radiologist’s report, summarize discrepancies and any additional findings, and present the result to you.

Special rule — ALWAYS:
Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Agents must conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator".

User, please confirm:
- Do you approve this plan?
- Can you confirm that we have permission to access the latest CT and CXR images and their radiologist reports for patient_4 via the PatientHistory agent? If not, please upload or provide direct links to the image files (DICOM or compatible) and the report texts.

If you approve, I will proceed as follows:
- PatientHistory, please proceed with retrieving for patient_4: the latest CT and CXR studies, corresponding image access (files/URLs) for the imaging tool, and the radiologist’s report texts for each study. Conclude with "back to you: Orchestrator".
