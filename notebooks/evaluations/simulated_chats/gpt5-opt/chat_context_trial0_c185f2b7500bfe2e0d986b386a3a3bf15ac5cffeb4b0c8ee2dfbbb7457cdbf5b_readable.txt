Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps:
- Clarify objectives, required outputs, and constraints for a tumor board preparation
- Confirm the plan and collect any missing inputs from you before engaging agents
- Sequence agents logically so each has the inputs they need from prior steps
- After each agent’s response, provide a micro-update and request/route any missing details
- Ensure each agent yields back control to me and that no clinical advice comes from me directly
- Validate completeness and assemble a final summary and report handoff

Proposed plan and sequence for Patient ID: patient_4:
- PatientHistory: Retrieve a structured timeline and concise history summary for patient_4. Then yield back. Note: Will only proceed with a valid patient ID string, which you’ve provided.
- PatientStatus: Build the current oncologic status (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG) using PatientHistory outputs. Then yield back.
- Radiology: Review available chest X-ray images (and other images if provided) and provide radiology insights. If no images are available, Radiology will note limitations or request them. Then yield back.
- ClinicalGuidelines: Provide guideline-based treatment considerations using PatientStatus. Then yield back.
- ClinicalTrials: Identify trial options suitable for the patient using PatientStatus. Then yield back.
- ReportCreation: Compile a tumor board Word document incorporating the patient timeline, clinical summary, imaging and pathology findings, and the treatment considerations and trials. Then yield back.
- MedicalResearch: Add brief research highlights (e.g., key studies or evolving standards) relevant to the case. Then yield back.

Special rule — ALWAYS: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator) by concluding with: “back to you: Orchestrator”.

Before we proceed, please confirm:
- Confirm the patient ID: patient_4 is correct.
- Imaging: Do you have chest X-ray or other imaging (e.g., PNG/JPG for X-ray) you want Radiology to analyze? If yes, please upload or provide a link. If not, should we proceed without Radiology image analysis?
- Trials location preference: What geographic location(s) should ClinicalTrials prioritize (city/state/country or “any”)?
- Research focus: Any specific topics you want MedicalResearch to emphasize (e.g., a biomarker, line of therapy, resistance mechanisms)?
- Report preferences: Default is a Word document (.docx). Any specific template or section headings you require?

Once you confirm, I will begin with PatientHistory for patient_4.
