If images are available, provide imaging insights; otherwise, we\u2019ll use available radiology reports.\\n- ClinicalGuidelines: Provide guideline-based options based on PatientStatus.\\n- ClinicalTrials: Identify relevant clinical trials using PatientStatus.\\n- MedicalResearch: Summarize recent research on a specified focus topic relevant to this case.\\n- ReportCreation: Assemble a tumor board Word document using all prior outputs.\\nSpecial rule: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent will conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\nWhat I need from you to proceed:\\n- Confirmation: May we proceed with this plan and retrieve patient_4\u2019s record?\\n- Imaging: Please upload or share access to imaging files (DICOM preferred; JPEG/PNG acceptable) for chest X-ray and CT, plus imaging dates. If images aren\u2019t available, please provide the official radiology reports.\\n- Pathology: Latest biopsy/surgical pathology report including histology and biomarkers (e.g., ER/PR/HER2, PD-L1, MSI, TMB, NGS panel), and the most recent path stage if available.\\n- Clinical details (if not in the record or to expedite):\\n  - Age, primary cancer site, histology subtype, clinical or pathologic stage.\\n  - Treatment history with dates and responses; current treatment plan.\\n  - ECOG performance status.\\n  - Key comorbidities, allergies, and any treatment contraindications.\\n  - Social history highlights relevant to oncology (e.g., smoking status).\\n- Research focus (for MedicalResearch): Any specific questions you want addressed (e.g., management after progression on X, role of biomarker Y, perioperative therapy evidence).\\n- Logistics: Target tumor board date/time and any institutional template requirements for the report.\\n\\nIf you confirm, I will begin by prompting:\\n- PatientHistory, please proceed with the timeline for patient_id = \\\"patient_4\\\".
