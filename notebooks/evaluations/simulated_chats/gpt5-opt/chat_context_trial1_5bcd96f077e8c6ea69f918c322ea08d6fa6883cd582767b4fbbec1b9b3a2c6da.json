Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\" after their response.\\n- Step 2: PatientStatus will synthesize a concise current status using the PatientHistory output (age, primary site, histology, biomarkers, staging, ECOG, and treatment history).\\n- Step 3 (conditional): Radiology will review imaging only if you can supply image files (e.g., CT, X-ray, or PET as DICOM/jpg). Otherwise, we will rely on the imaging report text from PatientHistory.\\n- Step 4: ReportCreation will produce a formatted Word document suitable for tumor board, incorporating biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, latest imaging findings, and standard sections (timeline, clinical summary, pathology, etc.). We will return the .docx as a downloadable/base64 file.\\n- Optional: If you later want trial options or literature context, we can engage ClinicalTrials and MedicalResearch after Step 4. We will avoid ClinicalGuidelines since you did not request recommendations.\\n\\nUser confirmation:\\n- User, please confirm the plan above. Also, do you have actual imaging files (CT, MRI, PET, X-ray) to upload for Radiology review, or should we rely on the latest imaging report text from the chart?\\n- Once confirmed, I will proceed with Step 1 (PatientHistory) using patient_4.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
