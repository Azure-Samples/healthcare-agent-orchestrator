USER:
Given the KRAS p.G12C mutation in patient_4, summarize current treatment options including KRAS inhibitors, chemo-immunotherapy, and emerging trial drugs. Include efficacy, risk profile, and how this may affect prognosis

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps:
- Clarify scope and confirm the patient ID and objective.
- Coordinate agents in a sequenced plan to gather patient-specific context first.
- Ensure each agent states what inputs they need and yields control back to me.
- Synthesize interim micro-updates after each agent’s response.
- Keep discussion informational only (no clinical recommendations).
- Validate completeness and conclude with a concise, integrated summary.

Plan and participation order:
- PatientHistory: Retrieve a concise timeline and history for patient_4.
- PatientStatus: Use the retrieved history to summarize current status (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).
- MedicalResearch: Summarize current evidence on KRAS G12C options—KRAS inhibitors, chemo-immunotherapy, and emerging agents—with efficacy data and risk profiles; discuss general prognostic implications.
- ClinicalTrials: Identify relevant ongoing trials for KRAS G12C tailored to the patient’s status.
- Orchestrator: Provide micro-updates after each handoff and a brief wrap-up summary.

Special rule:
Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator" after their response.

User, please confirm:
- Can I proceed using patient ID "patient_4" to retrieve the timeline and history?
- Any additional context you want highlighted (e.g., specific cancer type if known, prior lines of therapy, goals of care, or recent adverse events)? If unknown, we’ll obtain what we can from PatientHistory.
