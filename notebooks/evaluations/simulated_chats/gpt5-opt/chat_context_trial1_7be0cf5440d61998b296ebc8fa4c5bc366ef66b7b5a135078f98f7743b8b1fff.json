Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\" after their response.\\n\\nUser, please confirm this plan. To proceed efficiently with accurate trial matching, please provide:\\n- Geographic location: city, state/province, and country for patient_4.\\n- Maximum travel distance you are willing to consider (e.g., 25, 50, 100, 300+ miles or \u201cnational/anywhere\u201d).\\n- Trial preferences or constraints: acceptable phases (I/II/III), industry vs. academic sites, language requirements, and any insurance/travel constraints.\\n- Willingness to consider remote/tele-trial or decentralized elements if available.\\n- Any urgent timing considerations (e.g., target start date) or recent progression date if relevant.\\n\\nOnce you confirm, I will proceed with:\\n- PatientHistory, please retrieve the timeline and history for \\\"patient_4\\\" with tumor type, stage, KRAS mutation status, prior systemic therapies and lines, ECOG, and any location fields present in the chart.
