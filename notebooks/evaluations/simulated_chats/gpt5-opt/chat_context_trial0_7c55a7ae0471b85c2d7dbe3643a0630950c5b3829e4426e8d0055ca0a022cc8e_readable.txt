USER:
Identify and list active clinical trials that patient_4 is eligible for, based on tumor type, stage, KRAS mutation status, treatment history, and geographic location. Include trial phase and contact info.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps:
- Clarify the goal and confirm the workflow with you.
- Gather baseline patient details from PatientHistory using the patient ID.
- Derive a concise current status from PatientStatus, focusing on tumor type, stage, KRAS status, treatment history, performance status, and location.
- Use ClinicalTrials to identify active, location-relevant trials, including phase and contact info.
- Provide micro-updates after each step and close with a brief summary.

Proposed plan and participant order:
1) PatientHistory: Retrieve and summarize patient_4’s timeline and key clinical details (tumor type, stage, histology, biomarkers including KRAS, treatment history, ECOG performance status, and geographic location).
2) PatientStatus: Convert that information into a concise current status profile suitable for trial matching.
3) ClinicalTrials: Identify active trials that match patient_4’s status and location, listing trial phase and site/contact info.

Special rule — ALWAYS:
Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (Orchestrator). Agents, conclude with: “back to you: Orchestrator”.

User, please confirm:
- May I proceed with the above plan?
- What is patient_4’s preferred geographic location for trials (city/state/country) and any travel radius you’d consider (e.g., within 50 miles, statewide, nationwide)?
- If known, do you have any updates on KRAS mutation specifics (e.g., G12C, G12D), and current ECOG performance status? If unknown, I’ll first query PatientHistory and follow up if anything is missing.

If you confirm, I will start by engaging PatientHistory for patient_4.
