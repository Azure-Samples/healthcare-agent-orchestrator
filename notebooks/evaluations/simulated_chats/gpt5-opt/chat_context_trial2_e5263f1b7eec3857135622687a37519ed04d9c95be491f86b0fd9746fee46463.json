If not available, we will use the latest imaging findings from PatientHistory\u2019s notes.\\n- Step 4: ClinicalTrials (optional but helpful for tumor board context) will provide a brief overview of relevant trial categories/options based on PatientStatus.\\n- Step 5: ReportCreation will generate and export a cleanly formatted Word document for tumor board presentation, incorporating patient timeline, clinical summary, pathology, imaging findings, and treatment history; we can optionally include clinical trials and social/medical history if you prefer.\\n\\nSpecial rule \u2014 ALWAYS:\\nEach agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\nUser confirmation and needed inputs:\\n- User, please confirm that you\u2019d like us to proceed with the plan above.\\n- If you want Radiology to add image-based insights, please upload or provide access to the most recent imaging files (CT/MRI/X-ray) or at least the finalized radiology reports. Otherwise, we will rely on text-based imaging findings from the chart timeline.\\n- Do you want a brief \u201cClinical Trials\u201d section included in the Word document? If yes, we will run ClinicalTrials after PatientStatus.\\n- Any preferences for the Word document format (e.g., include social history, smoking history, family history, medications, allergies)? If you have a template, we can adapt to it.\\n- Delivery preference: we can provide the .docx as a downloadable base64-encoded file along with a filename. Is that acceptable?\\n\\nIf you confirm, I will proceed as follows:\\n1) PatientHistory, please retrieve the full patient timeline and concise history for patient_id = \\\"patient_4\\\". Remember to validate the ID and return status, patient_id, patient_timeline array, history_summary, and error_message per your JSON schema.
