If not, we will rely on the narrative imaging findings from the record without Radiology.\\n4) ReportCreation: Assemble a tumor-board-ready Word document including diagnostic summary, biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, and latest imaging findings.\\n\\nSpecial rule:\\nEach agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Agents should conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\nUser confirmation and needed inputs:\\n- Please confirm that you approve this plan.\\n- If available, please upload or provide access to the latest imaging files (DICOM preferred; JPEG/PNG acceptable). If unavailable, we will use the most recent imaging report from the chart.\\n- Do you have a preference for receiving the Word document as a downloadable .docx file or as a base64-encoded .docx string?\\n\\nOn your confirmation, I will proceed:\\n- PatientHistory, please proceed with the full timeline for patient_4.\\n- Then PatientStatus, followed by Radiology (if images are supplied), and finally ReportCreation to generate the Word document.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
