Also, if you already have direct links or files for the latest CT and CXR studies for patient_4 (DICOM or image series), you can share them to speed things up. If not, we will proceed to retrieve them via PatientHistory.\\n\\nBefore proceeding, I will ask the Radiology agent to confirm input requirements.\\n\\nRadiology, please confirm:\\n- Can you analyze both CT and CXR if provided as DICOM series or standard image exports? If there are limitations, specify them.\\n- What file formats do you prefer (e.g., DICOM, JPEG/PNG for CXR, NIfTI for CT), and do you require series descriptions or specific reconstructions for CT (e.g., lung kernel, mediastinal kernel, slice thickness)?\\n- Any additional metadata needed (e.g., study date, body part, projection for CXR, contrast phase for CT)?\\n\\nPlease conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"ai_model_id\": \"gpt-5\",\n      \"metadata\": {\n        \"logprobs\": null,\n        \"id\": \"chatcmpl-CBgWX93Hp4skGr8vPmWt2JGGT1gSZ\",\n        \"created\": 1756901105,\n        \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n        \"usage\": {\n          \"prompt_tokens\": 1817,\n          \"completion_tokens\": 1924\n        }\n      },\n      \"content_type\": \"message\",\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"name\": \"Radiology\",\n      \"items\": [\n        {\n          \"metadata\": {},\n          \"content_type\": \"text\",\n          \"text\": \"Checklist for this task\\n- Confirm modalities and scope: I can analyze CXR with our CXRReportGen tool; CT analysis is outside my current toolset.\\n- Obtain the latest CXR study for patient_4 with file(s), metadata, and the radiologist\u2019s finalized report.\\n- Ensure indication/reason for the CXR is available (from study metadata or provided) to feed into the model.\\n- Run CXRReportGen on the latest CXR and generate structured AI findings.\\n- Compare AI CXR findings to the radiologist\u2019s report and note discrepancies/additional findings; assess consistency with available clinical history.\\n- Provide a concise summary and hand back to Orchestrator; request CT analysis by a CT-capable agent.\\n\\nTool purpose and minimal input I will use\\n- Purpose: The CXRReportGen model generates AI findings for chest x-ray images.\\n- Minimal input required to run: patient_id, CXR filename, and a short indication (e.g., \u201cdyspnea,\u201d \u201cfever/cough,\u201d or the study\u2019s stated reason).\\n\\nCapabilities and limitations\\n- Chest X-ray (CXR): Supported. I will use the CXRReportGen tool to analyze the latest CXR for patient_4 once provided.\\n- CT Chest or other CT: Not supported by my toolset. Please route CT analysis to a CT-capable imaging agent.

For CT specifically, do you want:\\n  - Option A: Proceed with CXR AI analysis plus CT report-only summary (no AI comparison), or\\n  - Option B: Provide us with AI-generated CT findings (from your tool or vendor) so we can compare them to the radiologist\u2019s CT report?\\n- If you already have direct links/files for the latest CXR and CT for patient_4 (DICOM or image exports), please share them to speed things up. Otherwise, we will fetch them via PatientHistory after your confirmation.\\n\\nOnce you confirm:\\n- I will ask PatientHistory to retrieve the latest CT and CXR studies, metadata, and finalized reports for patient_4.\\n- Then Radiology will run CXRReportGen on the CXR and perform the AI vs. report comparison.\\n- I will complete the CT portion per your selected option and deliver the discrepancies/additional findings summary.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
