USER:
Identify and list active clinical trials that patient_4 is eligible for, based on tumor type, stage, KRAS mutation status, treatment history, and geographic location. Include trial phase and contact info.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps:
- Clarify the user’s goal and confirm the workflow and agent sequence.
- Collect required patient data and context (especially geography) to enable accurate trial matching.
- Coordinate agents in sequence, ensuring each has the inputs they require.
- Validate structured outputs (e.g., PatientHistory JSON) and hand off to next agent.
- Provide brief milestone updates after each agent completes and outline next steps.
- Maintain role boundaries (no clinical recommendations) and ensure agents yield control back.

Plan and participation order:
1) PatientHistory: Retrieve patient_4’s timeline, tumor type, stage, KRAS mutation status, treatment history, and any location details available in records.
2) PatientStatus: Summarize current status from PatientHistory (age, primary site, histology, staging, biomarkers including KRAS, treatment history, ECOG).
3) ClinicalTrials: Identify active trials the patient is eligible for based on tumor type, stage, KRAS status, treatment history, and geographic location; include trial phase and contact info.
Special rule: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator" after their response.

User, please confirm this plan. To proceed efficiently with accurate trial matching, please provide:
- Geographic location: city, state/province, and country for patient_4.
- Maximum travel distance you are willing to consider (e.g., 25, 50, 100, 300+ miles or “national/anywhere”).
- Trial preferences or constraints: acceptable phases (I/II/III), industry vs. academic sites, language requirements, and any insurance/travel constraints.
- Willingness to consider remote/tele-trial or decentralized elements if available.
- Any urgent timing considerations (e.g., target start date) or recent progression date if relevant.

Once you confirm, I will proceed with:
- PatientHistory, please retrieve the timeline and history for "patient_4" with tumor type, stage, KRAS mutation status, prior systemic therapies and lines, ECOG, and any location fields present in the chart. Conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator".
