Once provided, I will return a structured patient_timeline and a concise history_summary that includes pathology and molecular testing details. back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nMicro-update: PatientHistory has confirmed that a valid patient_id string is required to fetch the pathology/molecular data. Next, I will gather needed details from you.\\n\\nUser, to proceed, please provide:\\n- The patient ID (as a string).\\n- The list of biomarkers you want checked (\u201cthese biomarkers\u201d). If you don\u2019t have a list, I can scan all available reports and return every biomarker mentioned with its status.\\n- Scope preference: scan all historical reports, or only the most recent?\\n- Reporting preferences (optional): \\n  - Include test methodology and thresholds (e.g., PD-L1 TPS/CPS, MSI method, TMB units)? \\n  - Include genomic details like variant name, exon, VAF, copy number, fusions, and pathogenicity classification?\\n  - Note any dates for when results were obtained?\\n\\nUpon your confirmation and providing the patient ID (and biomarker list if applicable), I will:\\n1) Ask PatientHistory to retrieve the records.\\n2) Extract and summarize the biomarker findings for you.\\n3) Provide a micro-update and propose optional next steps (e.g., PatientStatus, ClinicalTrials, or ReportCreation).\\n\\nPlease confirm this plan and share the patient_id and biomarker list (or tell me to scan and list all biomarkers found).\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
