USER:
Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps:
- Clarify the objective and propose a step-by-step plan and agent sequence
- Confirm the plan with you and identify any missing inputs (e.g., imaging files)
- Collect the patient timeline and build the current clinical status from it
- Coordinate specialized agent inputs (radiology, guidelines, trials, research)
- Compile a tumor board report and summarize next steps
- Provide milestone updates after each agent’s response and manage handoffs

Proposed plan and participation order:
1) PatientHistory: Retrieve the full timeline and summary for patient_4.
2) PatientStatus: Build the current clinical status using timeline data (age, stage, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).
3) Radiology: Review available imaging or imaging reports; if images are available, analyze; if not, summarize based on reports and request missing files if needed.
4) ClinicalGuidelines: Provide guideline-aligned treatment options based on the PatientStatus summary.
5) ClinicalTrials: Identify relevant clinical trials matching the PatientStatus.
6) MedicalResearch: Summarize key research updates pertinent to the patient’s histology/biomarkers.
7) ReportCreation: Assemble a concise tumor board Word document incorporating the timeline, clinical summary, imaging/pathology highlights, and proposed options/trials/research.

Special rule — ALWAYS:
Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Agents: please conclude with, “back to you: Orchestrator”.

User confirmation and required inputs:
- User, please confirm that you approve this plan and sequence.
- Do you have imaging files to share (CT, MRI, PET-CT, X-ray) for patient_4? If yes, please upload or specify modalities and dates. If only reports are available, we will proceed with reports.
- Do you have any pathology PDFs or molecular reports (NGS, IHC, FISH) to include? If yes, please upload or specify key findings.
- Should any sensitive information be redacted in the final tumor board document?

Upon your confirmation, I will proceed with:
- PatientHistory, please proceed with retrieving the timeline and summary for patient ID "patient_4" per your JSON schema. Remember to end with “back to you: Orchestrator”.
