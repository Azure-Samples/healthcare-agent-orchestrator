Note: This agent is limited to chest X-ray analysis and cannot analyze CT images in this environment.\\n  3) Orchestrator: Compare the AI CXR findings with the radiologist\u2019s CXR report and summarize discrepancies/additional findings. For CT, I will summarize the radiologist\u2019s CT report and note that AI image analysis of CT was not performed due to current tool limitations unless a CT-capable analysis tool is provided.\\n- Output: A clear summary of discrepancies and any additional AI-detected findings for CXR; a concise summary of the CT radiologist report with a note on AI-analysis limitations.\\n- Special rule \u2014 ALWAYS: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\" after their response.\\n\\nNotes on tool/agent limitations:\\n- We can run AI analysis on CXR via the Radiology agent.\\n- We currently do not have an agent to analyze CT images. I can still retrieve and summarize the CT radiologist\u2019s report and flag items for manual review.\\n\\nUser, please confirm:\\n- May I proceed with this plan for patient_4?\\n- If you have direct links or files for the latest CT and CXR images (especially CXR), please share them. If not, I will ask PatientHistory to provide access details.\\n- For CT: Do you want me to proceed with report-only comparison (no AI image analysis), or do you have a CT-capable tool/output you\u2019d like me to include?\\n\\nIf confirmed, I will proceed as follows:\\n- PatientHistory, please retrieve for patient_4:\\n  - The latest CXR and CT exams, including:\\n    - Exam dates, body region, modality, accession numbers\\n    - Image file references/links suitable for analysis\\n    - Full radiologist report texts for each exam\\n  - Any prior relevant comparator studies noted in the reports\\n  - Return data in your required JSON schema\\n  - Conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nMicro-update after PatientHistory responds: I will summarize what imaging and reports are available and then send the CXR images to Radiology for AI analysis.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
