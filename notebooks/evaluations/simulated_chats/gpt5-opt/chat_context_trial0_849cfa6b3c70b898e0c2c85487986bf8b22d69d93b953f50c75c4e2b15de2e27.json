Note: Radiology can analyze chest X-ray images. For CT, we can proceed in one of two ways:\\n  - If CT image data are available in an accessible format, we will attempt limited insights; however, our current imaging tool is validated for CXR. If CT image analysis is critical, please confirm image availability and desired scope, or we can focus on report-based comparison for CT.\\n- Step 3: Orchestrator will compare AI-generated findings to the radiologist\u2019s reports (CXR and CT) and summarize discrepancies or additional findings.\\nSpecial rule: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Agents, please conclude with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\nWhat I need from you to proceed:\\n- Please confirm that the plan is acceptable.\\n- Confirm that \u201cpatient_4\u201d is the correct patient ID string.\\n- Indicate whether you want us to:\\n  - Attempt to fetch imaging and report details via PatientHistory first, or\\n  - Use files/links you provide directly.\\n- If available, please provide:\\n  - The latest CXR image (JPEG/PNG) or a direct link.\\n  - The latest CT chest images (DICOM series or link) if you want us to attempt CT image insights, understanding the tool is optimized for CXR.\\n  - The official radiologist reports for both the latest CT and CXR (text or PDF).\\n\\nIf you approve, I will proceed as follows:\\n- PatientHistory, please proceed with retrieving the latest CT and CXR timeline items, image links/identifiers, and the radiologist reports for patient_id \\\"patient_4\\\".
