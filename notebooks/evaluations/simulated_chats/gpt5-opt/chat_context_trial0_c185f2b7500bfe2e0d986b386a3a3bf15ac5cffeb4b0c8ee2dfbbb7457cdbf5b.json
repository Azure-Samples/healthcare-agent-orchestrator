Then yield back. Note: Will only proceed with a valid patient ID string, which you\u2019ve provided.\\n- PatientStatus: Build the current oncologic status (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG) using PatientHistory outputs. Then yield back.\\n- Radiology: Review available chest X-ray images (and other images if provided) and provide radiology insights. If no images are available, Radiology will note limitations or request them. Then yield back.\\n- ClinicalGuidelines: Provide guideline-based treatment considerations using PatientStatus. Then yield back.\\n- ClinicalTrials: Identify trial options suitable for the patient using PatientStatus. Then yield back.\\n- ReportCreation: Compile a tumor board Word document incorporating the patient timeline, clinical summary, imaging and pathology findings, and the treatment considerations and trials. Then yield back.\\n- MedicalResearch: Add brief research highlights (e.g., key studies or evolving standards) relevant to the case. Then yield back.\\n\\nSpecial rule \u2014 ALWAYS: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator) by concluding with: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\nBefore we proceed, please confirm:\\n- Confirm the patient ID: patient_4 is correct.\\n- Imaging: Do you have chest X-ray or other imaging (e.g., PNG/JPG for X-ray) you want Radiology to analyze? If yes, please upload or provide a link. If not, should we proceed without Radiology image analysis?\\n- Trials location preference: What geographic location(s) should ClinicalTrials prioritize (city/state/country or \u201cany\u201d)?\\n- Research focus: Any specific topics you want MedicalResearch to emphasize (e.g., a biomarker, line of therapy, resistance mechanisms)?\\n- Report preferences: Default is a Word document (.docx). Any specific template or section headings you require?\\n\\nOnce you confirm, I will begin with PatientHistory for patient_4.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
