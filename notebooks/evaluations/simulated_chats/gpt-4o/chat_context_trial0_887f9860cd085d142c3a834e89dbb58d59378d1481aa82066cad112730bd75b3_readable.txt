ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
To analyze the CT and CXR images for patient_4, we'll need to follow a structured plan. Here's the proposed sequence for our task:

1. **PatientHistory**: We'll begin by retrieving the imaging information, which includes the latest CT and CXR images for patient_4. Could you provide us with the patient ID, *User*? 
2. **Radiology**: Once we have the images, the Radiology agent will analyze them to extract radiology insights. This includes comparing artificial intelligence-generated findings with the radiologist’s report to identify any discrepancies or additional findings.
3. **Orchestrator**: I will then summarize any discrepancies or additional findings discovered during the analysis.

After each agent completes their task, they will yield back to me (Orchestrator) for the smooth continuation of the plan.

*User*, could you confirm the patient ID so we can proceed?
