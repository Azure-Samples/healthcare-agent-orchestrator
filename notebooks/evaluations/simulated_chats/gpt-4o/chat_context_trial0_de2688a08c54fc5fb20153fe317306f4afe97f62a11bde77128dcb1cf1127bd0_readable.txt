ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
To analyze the CT and CXR images for patient_4, we'll need to follow a structured plan. Here's the proposed approach:

1. **PatientHistory**: We'll start by gathering the timeline and obtaining the necessary CT and CXR images from the patient's records.

2. **Radiology**: Following that, we will perform an AI analysis of the images and provide insights.

3. **Comparison**: We'll compare the AI-generated findings with the radiologist’s report to identify any discrepancies or additional findings.

Here is the detailed plan with the expected order of participants:

1. **PatientHistory**, please obtain and provide the CT and CXR images for patient_4 using the patient's ID. Once done, yield the chat back to me with "back to you: Orchestrator."

2. **Radiology**, you will analyze the images and provide radiology insights. After completing your analysis, yield the chat back to me with "back to you: Orchestrator."

3. **Orchestrator**: I'll then summarize any discrepancies or additional findings based on the AI analysis compared to the radiologist's report.

Let me know, *User*, if you agree with this approach, or if there are other considerations we should keep in mind. Once confirmed, we can proceed!
