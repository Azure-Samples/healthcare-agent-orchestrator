ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Certainly, I will assist in preparing a tumor board review for Patient ID: patient_4. Here is the planned sequence of participants:

1. **PatientHistory**: Obtain the patient's timeline, medical history, social history, and cancer type. This will provide the necessary context for the subsequent agents and may include primary site, histology, biomarkers, and treatment history.

2. **Radiology**: Analyze any x-ray images provided by PatientHistory for radiology insights.

3. **PatientStatus**: Use the details gathered from PatientHistory to assess the current status of the patient, including age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, and ECOG performance status.

4. **ClinicalGuidelines**: Based on the patient's status, provide treatment recommendations.

5. **ClinicalTrials**: Explore available clinical trials relevant to the patient's current status.

6. **MedicalResearch**: Conduct a research inquiry if needed to gather the latest data related to the patientâ€™s condition.

7. **ReportCreation**: Compile all gathered information into a comprehensive word document suitable for the tumor board review.

Each agent will complete their task and yield the chat back to me, the Orchestrator, by saying "back to you: Orchestrator."

Let's begin with **PatientHistory**. *PatientHistory*, proceed with retrieving the timeline, medical history, social history, and cancer type for Patient ID: patient_4.
