The ECOG performance status for patient_4, Jane M. Doe, is 1.

With this information, we now have a comprehensive understanding of the patient's current status. I will now send this compiled data to the ClinicalGuidelines and ClinicalTrials agents for their analysis and treatment recommendations.

back to you: Orchestrator

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: ClinicalGuidelines):
Thank you, PatientHistory, for compiling and verifying the detailed status of patient_4, Jane M. Doe. 

Now, using the detailed patient status we have compiled, I will forward the information to the ClinicalGuidelines agent to provide the appropriate treatment recommendations, considering the progression and molecular details observed (e.g., KRAS mutation for KRAS-directed treatment interest). ClinicalTrials will also be engaged to seek any suitable ongoing clinical trials.

Let me proceed with consulting ClinicalGuidelines first for the treatment plan.

ClinicalGuidelines, please provide a treatment recommendation, given the current progression with the known KRAS mutation. We are considering the next steps post-Pembrolizumab as well as surveillance strategies. Please also consider any relevant biomarkers in the analysis.

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: ClinicalTrials):
Based on a detailed search for clinical trials related to patient_4's current status, no clinical trials match all eligibility criteria for the patient's inclusion. Here is a brief summary of the findings:

### Search Query Used
- Biomarker: "KRAS"
- Staging: "Stage IV"
- Histology: "Adenocarcinoma"

### Clinical Trials Reviewed
1. **[NCT07148128: Phase 1/2a Study of WEF-001 for KRAS-Mutant Solid Tumours](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07148128)**
   - **Reason for Non-Eligibility:** The trial requires explicit documentation of progressive disease after standard therapy, confirmation of RECIST v1.1 measurable disease, and ruling out specific exclusions (e.g., active infection or untreated brain metastases).

2. **[NCT06704724: A Study of PF-07985045 in Advanced Solid Tumors](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06704724)**
   - **Reason for Non-Eligibility:** While the patient fits many key criteria, eligibility cannot be confirmed due to missing documentation of RECIST-measurable disease, KRAS mutation and variant, progression on prior specified therapies, and ruling out disqualifying medical conditions.

3. **[NCT07064018: SPEDOX-6 in Advanced Malignancies](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07064018)**
   - **Reason for Non-Eligibility:** The primary reason is the absence of documented RECIST v1.1 measurable disease and required laboratory values for hematologic and organ function. Additional information and confirmation of progression details are also necessary.

4. **[NCT06364696: ASP4396 in Adults With Solid Tumors](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06364696)**
   - **Reason for Non-Eligibility:** The crucial criterion is the absence of documentation for a KRAS G12D mutation, alongside inadequate data on organ function and measurable disease.

5. **[NCT03260491: U3-1402 in Metastatic NSCLC](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03260491)**
   - **Reason for Non-Eligibility:** Specific criteria pertaining to RECIST-measurable lesions, documented progression, and absence of EGFR mutations are missing. KRAS mutation G12C status and corresponding treatment require confirmation for certain cohorts.

6. **[NCT06447662: PF-07934040 Study in Advanced Solid Tumors](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06447662)**
   - **Reason for Non-Eligibility:** Requires specific KRAS mutation documentation, measurable disease, and ruling out exclusions related to prior therapy and laboratory parameters.

### Conclusion
The main barriers to eligibility are the lack of specific KRAS mutation documentation, confirmed RECIST v1.1 measurable disease, and adherence to exclusion criteria (e.g., absence of CNS metastases or specific organ dysfunction).

I recommend reviewing the patient's medical records for detailed mutation analysis and additional diagnostics to address these gaps. If these can be confirmed or corrected, identifying a suitable clinical trial may become feasible. 

Please let me know if you would like further assistance, or details on any specific trial.

ASSISTANT (agent id: ClinicalGuidelines):
**Patient Summary:**
Jane M. Doe is a 61-year-old female patient with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), diagnosed as adenocarcinoma, and carrying a possible KRAS mutation. Her prior treatment included standard chemotherapy with Taxol and Carboplatin, followed by six cycles of chemotherapy combined with Pembrolizumab. Post-chemotherapy, she transitioned to Pembrolizumab maintenance. However, her recent PET/CT indicated disease progression, marked by increased FDG avidity and enlarging left lung mass. She has an ECOG performance status of 1, and her current status necessitates a shift in treatment strategy, particularly due to suspected KRAS involvement.

**Treatment Plan:**

**1. Continue/Initiate/Modify:**
   *Initiate adagrasib (MRTX849)* as a potential KRAS-directed therapy. Pending exact mutation confirmation, targeted options such as adagrasib may offer benefits, especially given her progression on Pembrolizumab.

**2. Rationale:**
   The consideration of KRAS-directed therapy is suggested due to the disease's continued progression post immune checkpoint inhibition, and literature supporting KRAS-targeted agents for NSCLC, particularly when standard therapies demonstrate limited efficacy. The KRAS expression aligns with promising initial responses seen in trials involving agents like adagrasib.

**3. Surveillance & Consults:**
   - *Confirm KRAS mutation and specific variant analysis* to fine-tune targeted therapeutic options. 
   - Regular monitoring through *quarterly PET/CT scans* to evaluate response.
   - Perform RECIST v1.1 evaluation to document measurable disease status.

**4. Progression-Contingency Options:**
   If progression occurs despite KRAS-directed treatment, consider:
   - Switching to other experimental agents if specific secondary mutations are observed.
   - Evaluate enrollment in clinical trials specific to NSCLC post-KRAS treatment efficacy or novel immunotherapeutic approaches.

**5. Maintenance / Supportive Care:**
   - Implement supportive care and symptomatic management for any treatment-related adverse effects, with close monitoring of pulmonary function.
   - Regular nutritional and psychological evaluation to maintain quality of life and assess overall performance status for ongoing treatment eligibility.

**Note:** Given the clinical trial search outcomes, the patient currently does not meet the eligibility for KRAS-specific trials due to missing explicit KRAS variant documentation and RECIST measurable disease confirmation. Enhanced diagnostic procedures and detailed mutation profiling are recommended to navigate forthcoming clinical pathways effectively.

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: MedicalResearch):
I encountered an issue while attempting to use Microsoft GraphRAG for retrieving pertinent literature-based prognostic estimates for your query. This may be due to a system error in processing the request. 

However, generally speaking, prognosis for stage IV NSCLC, particularly with KRAS mutations, can vary based on several factors, such as:
- **Overall Survival**: Historically, stage IV lung cancer had a median overall survival of less than one year, but advancements in targeted therapies, like those for KRAS mutations, have been improving survival rates incrementally.
- **KRAS Mutations**: Patients with KRAS mutations represent a challenging subgroup as they traditionally have poorer outcomes; however, newer therapies (including investigational agents) are attempting to bridge this gap by targeting these mutations more effectively.
- **Treatment Advances with Targeted Therapies**: Emerging treatments, especially those targeting specific mutations such as KRAS, may prolong survival and improve quality of life, but availability and response are contingent on verifying the specific KRAS mutation.

If you require further, detailed statistics, I suggest consulting the latest clinical data or discussing with an oncologist familiar with recent advances in treatment and ongoing clinical trials that may apply to this specific patient context. If there is anything further I can assist you with, please let me know.

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: ClinicalGuidelines):
Based on the accumulated insights from our assessments, here's a brief synthesis addressing the prognosis for patient_4, Jane M. Doe:

**Prognosis Summary:**
1. **General Outlook for Stage IV NSCLC**: The median overall survival for stage IV NSCLC traditionally hovers around 8-12 months, though individual variance is notable due to factors like performance status, treatment response, and molecular profile. Advances with immunotherapy and personalized medicine show promise in altering this trajectory positively.

2. **Impact of KRAS Mutation**: The presence of a KRAS mutation typically signals a more advanced therapeutic challenge due to historically limited therapeutic options. However, with evolving treatments targeting KRAS mutations specifically (e.g., adagrasib), prognosis could further improve, pending confirmation of mutation specifics and therapeutic availability.

3. **Potential Benefits of Targeted Therapy**: Patients who meet criteria for KRAS-directed or other molecular-targeted therapies generally experience an enhanced quality of life and potentially improved survival metrics. It is critical to confirm the specific KRAS mutation subtype (e.g., G12C), as this impacts eligibility and efficacy for tailored therapies.

4. **Future Directions**: Verification of comprehensive mutation analysis and RECIST-measurable disease is crucial for accessing new treatment avenues or clinical trials, which could further extend survival and ameliorate outcomes for this patient cohort.

Given these considerations, continued focus on targeted treatment strategies—complemented by advancements in the pharmacologic landscape for KRAS mutations—provides a credible path forward to optimistically manage the prognosis.

ASSISTANT (agent id: MedicalResearch):
I have used Microsoft GraphRAG to retrieve the information. Here are the insights gathered for patient_4's prognosis and possible progression pathways:

The patient, aged 59, initially presented with symptoms leading to the diagnosis of Stage IV NSCLC, adenocarcinoma, a condition characterized by identified lingular mass in the left lung. Following the commencement of chemotherapy alongside Pembrolizumab, subsequent imaging through PET/CT indicated partial initial response, although disease progression has since been noted, evidenced by increased FDG avidity on recent scans. Continuing with Pembrolizumab post-chemotherapy cycles, the patient's prognosis is contingent on further mutation analysis to guide potential therapeutic interventions.

For KRAS mutations, particularly, the prognosis can be variably influenced by the availability and patient's response to emerging targeted therapies. Traditional survival estimates for stage IV lung adenocarcinoma may not reflect the potential outcome possibilities if pathway-specific treatment formulations are pursued. Patients identified with targetable KRAS mutations, for instance, may be candidates for investigational treatments like adagrasib, which are showing promise.

Key elements that could influence prognosis and survival:
- **Mutation Analysis**: Complete confirmation of KRAS mutation and variant is essential, as it may open sophisticated treatment options.
- **Specificity of Treatment**: Emerging KRAS-directed treatments have the potential to extend survival and quality of life but require mutation-specific verification.
- **Clinical Trial Considerations**: Due to typical investigative nature and progress rates, clinical trial participation could present novel opportunities beyond standard regimens.

Understanding exact mutation specifics and aligning treatment with personalized genomic data remain critical to dictating prognosis and optimizing therapeutic avenues.
