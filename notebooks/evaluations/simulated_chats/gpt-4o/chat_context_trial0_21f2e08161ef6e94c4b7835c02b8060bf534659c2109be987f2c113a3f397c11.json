Doe is a 61-year-old female patient with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), diagnosed as adenocarcinoma, and carrying a possible KRAS mutation. Her prior treatment included standard chemotherapy with Taxol and Carboplatin, followed by six cycles of chemotherapy combined with Pembrolizumab. Post-chemotherapy, she transitioned to Pembrolizumab maintenance. However, her recent PET/CT indicated disease progression, marked by increased FDG avidity and enlarging left lung mass. She has an ECOG performance status of 1, and her current status necessitates a shift in treatment strategy, particularly due to suspected KRAS involvement.\\n\\n**Treatment Plan:**\\n\\n**1. Continue/Initiate/Modify:**\\n   *Initiate adagrasib (MRTX849)* as a potential KRAS-directed therapy. Pending exact mutation confirmation, targeted options such as adagrasib may offer benefits, especially given her progression on Pembrolizumab.\\n\\n**2. Rationale:**\\n   The consideration of KRAS-directed therapy is suggested due to the disease's continued progression post immune checkpoint inhibition, and literature supporting KRAS-targeted agents for NSCLC, particularly when standard therapies demonstrate limited efficacy. The KRAS expression aligns with promising initial responses seen in trials involving agents like adagrasib.\\n\\n**3. Surveillance & Consults:**\\n   - *Confirm KRAS mutation and specific variant analysis* to fine-tune targeted therapeutic options. \\n   - Regular monitoring through *quarterly PET/CT scans* to evaluate response.\\n   - Perform RECIST v1.1 evaluation to document measurable disease status.\\n\\n**4. Progression-Contingency Options:**\\n   If progression occurs despite KRAS-directed treatment, consider:\\n   - Switching to other experimental agents if specific secondary mutations are observed.\\n   - Evaluate enrollment in clinical trials specific to NSCLC post-KRAS treatment efficacy or novel immunotherapeutic approaches.\\n\\n**5. Maintenance / Supportive Care:**\\n   - Implement supportive care and symptomatic management for any treatment-related adverse effects, with close monitoring of pulmonary function.\\n   - Regular nutritional and psychological evaluation to maintain quality of life and assess overall performance status for ongoing treatment eligibility.\\n\\n**Note:** Given the clinical trial search outcomes, the patient currently does not meet the eligibility for KRAS-specific trials due to missing explicit KRAS variant documentation and RECIST measurable disease confirmation.

Advances with immunotherapy and personalized medicine show promise in altering this trajectory positively.\\n\\n2. **Impact of KRAS Mutation**: The presence of a KRAS mutation typically signals a more advanced therapeutic challenge due to historically limited therapeutic options. However, with evolving treatments targeting KRAS mutations specifically (e.g., adagrasib), prognosis could further improve, pending confirmation of mutation specifics and therapeutic availability.\\n\\n3. **Potential Benefits of Targeted Therapy**: Patients who meet criteria for KRAS-directed or other molecular-targeted therapies generally experience an enhanced quality of life and potentially improved survival metrics. It is critical to confirm the specific KRAS mutation subtype (e.g., G12C), as this impacts eligibility and efficacy for tailored therapies.\\n\\n4. **Future Directions**: Verification of comprehensive mutation analysis and RECIST-measurable disease is crucial for accessing new treatment avenues or clinical trials, which could further extend survival and ameliorate outcomes for this patient cohort.\\n\\nGiven these considerations, continued focus on targeted treatment strategies\u2014complemented by advancements in the pharmacologic landscape for KRAS mutations\u2014provides a credible path forward to optimistically manage the prognosis.\\n\\nPlease reach out if further clarification or additional details are needed.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"ai_model_id\": \"gpt-4o\",\n      \"metadata\": {\n        \"logprobs\": null,\n        \"id\": \"chatcmpl-CAuciS0SO8t1IAGKwPOJdLXSutC0c\",\n        \"created\": 1756716976,\n        \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_8458c98457\",\n        \"usage\": {\n          \"prompt_tokens\": 15823,\n          \"completion_tokens\": 16\n        }\n      },\n      \"content_type\": \"message\",\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"name\": \"PatientStatus\",\n      \"items\": [\n        {\n          \"metadata\": {},\n          \"content_type\": \"text\",\n          \"text\": \"If you have more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"ai_model_id\": \"gpt-4o\",\n      \"metadata\": {\n        \"logprobs\": null,\n        \"id\": \"chatcmpl-CAuctaOJFIzV3zF5PT0TTPnGglH8n\",\n        \"created\": 1756716987,\n        \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_8458c98457\",\n        \"usage\": {\n          \"prompt_tokens\": 15867,\n          \"completion_tokens\": 96\n        }\n      },\n      \"content_type\": \"message\",\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"name\": \"PatientStatus\",\n      \"items\": [\n        {\n          \"metadata\": {},\n          \"content_type\": \"text\",\n          \"text\": \"I'm sorry, but I cannot proceed without complete information.
