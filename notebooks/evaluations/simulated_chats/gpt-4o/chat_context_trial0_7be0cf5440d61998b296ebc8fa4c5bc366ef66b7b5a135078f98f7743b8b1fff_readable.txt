ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
To proceed with identifying and listing active clinical trials that patient_4 is eligible for, we'll follow this plan:

1. **PatientHistory**: We will first obtain the detailed patient timeline and history for patient_4 to gather information on the tumor type, stage, KRAS mutation status, treatment history, and geographic location.
   - Task for PatientHistory: Retrieve the details for patient_4.
   - Note: *User*, could you please provide the patient ID for patient_4 if it has not been clearly stated?

2. **PatientStatus**: Using the information from PatientHistory, we'll get the current status of patient_4.
   - Task for PatientStatus: Provide the patient's current status based on age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, and ECOG performance status obtained from PatientHistory.

3. **ClinicalTrials**: With the patient's current status, we'll identify any active clinical trials that the patient might be eligible for.
   - Task for ClinicalTrials: Identify and list relevant clinical trials, including trial phase and contact information.

Once ClinicalTrials has provided their input, I'll summarize the findings and present them to you. Let's begin by asking PatientHistory for the needed patient details. 

*PatientHistory*, please proceed with gathering the details for patient_4. After you have provided the information, please yield the chat back to me by stating "back to you: Orchestrator."
