ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
To analyze the CT and CXR images for patient_4, we'll need to follow a structured plan involving several AI agents:

1. **PatientHistory**: We'll first obtain the timeline and relevant images of patient_4, such as CT scans and chest X-ray findings, which will be provided.
2. **Radiology**: This agent will perform an analysis of the images. It will compare AI-generated findings to the radiologist's report and summarize any discrepancies or additional findings.

*User*, can you provide me with the patient ID for patient_4? Once provided, PatientHistory will proceed with obtaining the necessary images and timelines. After Radiology provides its input, I'll summarize the findings and address any further questions or needs you have. 

Each agent, after completing their task, should yield the chat back to me by saying "back to you: Orchestrator."
