ASSISTANT (agent id: Radiology):
It seems there was an issue locating the chest x-ray file named "latest_chest_xray_patient4.jpg" for analysis. Without the chest x-ray image, I can't provide findings at this time.

If you have the correct filename or access to the image, please provide it so we can continue with the radiological examination. Otherwise, we can proceed with the existing data for further analysis by the other agents.

Let's move forward with the next step. *PatientStatus*, please provide the current status of Patient ID: patient_4.

USER:
Orchestrator: Thank you, PatientStatus. Next, could you please answer the following follow-up question: - What are the known biomarkers for this patientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cancer and what is the presence of each of those biomarkers based on the reports in the patientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s record?

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: PatientStatus):
The known biomarkers for this patient's cancer and their status are as follows:

- **KRAS**: The patient has a KRAS p.G12C mutation.
- **PD-L1**: The patient is PD-L1 negative.

These biomarkers have been identified through NGS testing as part of the patient's diagnostic workup and treatment planning.

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Thank you for providing the follow-up information.

We'll now proceed with *ClinicalGuidelines* to offer treatment recommendations based on this comprehensive data. Once you've completed your analysis, please yield the chat back to me, Orchestrator.

ASSISTANT (agent id: ClinicalGuidelines):
### Patient Summary:
Patient ID: Patient_4 is a 60-year-old female with Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) histologically confirmed as adenocarcinoma. The patient presented with a KRAS p.G12C mutation and PD-L1 negativity. Her treatment history includes initial systemic therapy with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and pembrolizumab, followed by maintenance with pembrolizumab alone. However, subsequent disease progression necessitated a switch to KRAS-directed therapy with adagrasib.

### Treatment Plan:
- **Continue Current Treatment**: Maintain the current regimen of adagrasib as the patient has progressed on pembrolizumab and is KRAS p.G12C positive, which is targeted by adagrasib.
  - **Rationale**: KRAS p.G12C mutation provides the biological target for adagrasib, aiming for improved specificity and efficacy.
  
- **Surveillance & Consults**: 
  - Continue routine CT scans every 3 months to monitor treatment response and disease progression.
  - Regular follow-up with oncology to adjust treatment as necessary. 
  - Regular check of thyroid function given the history of hypothyroidism and previous high TSH levels; ensure levothyroxine therapy is optimized.

- **Progression-Contingency Options**: 
  - If disease progresses despite adagrasib therapy, consider enrollment in a clinical trial targeting novel agents for KRAS mutations or further chemotherapy options not yet exhausted. 
  - Re-evaluate potential biopsy for additional mutations and overall disease character to consider the broader spectrum of targeted agents.

- **Maintenance / Supportive Care**: 
  - Ensure supportive care addressing hypertension and diabetes management alongside oncological treatment.
  - Address hypothyroidism with appropriate thyroid replacement therapy and follow-up testing.

Yielding the chat back to Orchestrator for any further actions.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Thank you, ClinicalGuidelines. 

Now, we'll proceed with *ClinicalTrials* to provide information on potential clinical trials suitable for the patient based on the status provided by PatientStatus. After your response, please yield the chat back to me, Orchestrator.

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: ClinicalTrials):
Based on the clinical trials search, here are the potential trials for which Patient ID: patient_4 may be eligible:

### Eligible Trials:

1. **[NCT04449874](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04449874): A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Activity of GDC-6036 Alone or in Combination in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors With a KRAS G12C Mutation**
   - **Explanation:** The patient meets the inclusion criteria for this trial, which requires Stage IV NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation, and allows previous exposure to KRAS G12C inhibitors like adagrasib. This makes the patient eligible provided there are no exclusion factors such as active brain metastases or significant absorption issues.

2. **[NCT06162221](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06162221): Study of RAS(ON) Inhibitors in Patients With Advanced RAS-mutated NSCLC**
   - **Explanation:** The patient is eligible for this trial, as it matches the disease stage (Stage IV NSCLC with KRAS p.G12C mutation) and prior usage of KRAS G12C inhibitors does not exclude eligibility. Final uptake into the trial depends on confirming safety parameters like organ function, no primary CNS tumor, and any conditions that may impair drug absorption.

3. **[NCT04185883](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04185883): Sotorasib Activity in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors With KRAS p.G12C Mutation (CodeBreak 101)**
   - **Explanation:** The trial's criteria are met with the patientâ€™s Stage IV NSCLC and KRAS p.G12C mutation. Prior treatments do not pose exclusion issues; however, aseptic checks on neurological and cardiac status and confirmatory tests in compliance with local regulations are recommended.

### Trials Not Suitable Due to Previous KRAS G12C Inhibitor Use:

Many trials exclude patients with prior KRAS G12C inhibitor therapy. The patient's history of adagrasib use prohibits participation in these particular trials.

If you want further information about any specific trial or need details on why other trials are not suitable, please let me know.
