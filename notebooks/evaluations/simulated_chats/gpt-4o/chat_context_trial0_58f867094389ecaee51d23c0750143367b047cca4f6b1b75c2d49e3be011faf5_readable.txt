ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
To analyze the CT and CXR images for patient_4, we'll need to follow a structured plan. Here's the proposed plan for our task:

1. **PatientHistory**: We'll begin by retrieving the imaging information, which includes the latest CT and CXR images for patient_4. Could you provide this information, including the patient ID?

2. **Radiology**: Once we have the imaging information, the Radiology agent will analyze the CT and CXR images to generate AI-based findings.

3. **Comparison and Summary**: After obtaining the AI-generated findings, we'll compare them to the radiologist's report, which should be part of the patient notes or history. We'll summarize any discrepancies or additional findings.

Each agent will yield the chat back to me (Orchestrator) after completing their task. Let's begin by getting the patient ID and imaging information. 

*User*, can you provide me with the patient ID for patient_4?
