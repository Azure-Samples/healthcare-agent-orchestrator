ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
To generate a comprehensive diagnostic summary for Patient ID: patient_4, we're going to follow a structured approach involving multiple AI agents. Hereâ€™s the planned order of participation:

1. **PatientHistory**: We'll begin with retrieving the patient's timeline, including biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, and treatment history. PatientHistory will need the Patient ID, which has already been provided.

2. **Radiology**: Once PatientHistory has provided the timeline and the necessary imaging data, Radiology will analyze the latest imaging findings.

3. **PatientStatus**: PatientStatus will then provide an overview of the patient's current status based on the detailed information from PatientHistory.

4. **ReportCreation**: Finally, we'll have ReportCreation compile all the gathered information into a formatted Word document suitable for a tumor board presentation.

Each agent, after completing their task, should yield the chat back to me (Orchestrator). Let's begin:

**PatientHistory**, please proceed with Patient ID: patient_4.
