ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Plan and order of participants:
- Orchestrator will coordinate the workflow.
- PatientHistory will provide the latest CT and CXR images for patient_4 and the radiologist’s report.
- Radiology will analyze the provided images and generate AI-style findings for CT and CXR.
- Orchestrator will compare AI findings to the radiologist’s report and summarize discrepancies or additions.
- ReportCreation or ClinicalGuidelines are not required unless you want a formal chart review document; for this task we’ll keep it concise.

Important note for workflow: Each agent, after completing their task, should yield the chat back to you (Orchestrator). Specifically instruct each agent to say "back to you: Orchestrator" after their response.

What I need from you to proceed:
- User, please confirm you want me to pull the latest CT and CXR images for patient_4 and proceed with AI radiology analysis and comparison to the radiologist’s report.
- If you have the images readily available, please attach them or provide access. If not, please confirm that I should retrieve the latest CT and CXR from the patient record for patient_4.
- If available, also share the date of the latest CT and the latest CXR (in case I need to verify which “latest” is intended).

Once you confirm and provide access to the images (or permission to retrieve them), I will:
1) Request from PatientHistory the latest CT and CXR images for patient_4 plus the current radiologist’s report. back to you: Orchestrator
2) Have Radiology analyze the CT and CXR and return AI-generated findings. back to you: Orchestrator
3) Compare AI findings to the radiologist’s report and summarize any discrepancies or additional findings. back to you: Orchestrator
4) Present a concise summary of discrepancies and any significant additions, and note any images or findings that may warrant further review. back to you: Orchestrator

Would you like me to proceed with retrieving/receiving the images now?
