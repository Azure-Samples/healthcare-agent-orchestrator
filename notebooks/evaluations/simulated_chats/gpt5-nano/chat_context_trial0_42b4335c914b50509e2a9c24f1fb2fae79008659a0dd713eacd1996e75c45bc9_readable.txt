ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Plan and expected participant order

Purpose:
- Generate a comprehensive diagnostic summary for Patient ID: patient_4, including biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, and latest imaging findings.
- Export the summary as a formatted Word document suitable for tumor board presentation.

Proposed execution order and responsibilities:
1) PatientHistory
   - Retrieve patient timeline, demographics, cancer type, initial diagnosis date, biomarker status if available, and comprehensive medical history.
   - Output: patient timeline and history to inform diagnostic summary.
   - Instruction to agent: "*PatientHistory*, proceed with patient_4."
   - After response: back to you: Orchestrator

2) Radiology
   - Retrieve latest imaging findings (CT, MRI, PET-CT, X-ray as available) and radiology reports, including any notable measurements and progression.
   - Output: imaging findings and key radiology conclusions.
   - Instruction to agent: "*Radiology*, proceed with latest imaging for patient_4."
   - After response: back to you: Orchestrator

3) PatientStatus
   - Compile current status details: age, primary site, histology, biomarkers, staging (at diagnosis and current if available), ECOG, and treatment history to date.
   - Output: current status summary necessary for the diagnostic report.
   - Instruction to agent: "*PatientStatus*, proceed with patient_4 status extraction."
   - After response: back to you: Orchestrator

4) ClinicalTrials (optional but recommended)
   - Identify any open or known relevant clinical trials for which the patient may be eligible or has been enrolled, and summarize trial status.
   - Output: list of applicable trials with eligibility notes.
   - Instruction to agent: "*ClinicalTrials*, proceed with patient_4 trial status."
   - After response: back to you: Orchestrator

5) ReportCreation
   - Create a formatted Word document suitable for tumor board, including:
     - Patient timeline
     - Clinical summary
     - Medical history
     - Social history (if available)
     - Cancer type and pathology
     - Imaging findings (CT/MRI/X-ray) with key notes
     - Pathology findings (biomarkers, receptor status, mutations)
     - Biomarker status
     - Stage at diagnosis and current stage (if available)
     - Treatment history to date (regimens, dates, responses)
     - Current status (ECOG, labs if pertinent)
     - Clinical trials (if any)
     - Any caveats or uncertainties
   - Output: a Word document ready for download or sharing with the tumor board.
   - Instruction to agent: "*ReportCreation*, proceed with compiling the document using the collected data for patient_4."
   - After response: back to you: Orchestrator

6) (Optional) Review and finalization
   - If any data is missing or inconsistent, loop back to the relevant agent to fill gaps and update the document.

User confirmation needed
- Please confirm that you want me to proceed with the above plan to collect data from the designated agents and generate the Word document for tumor board presentation.
- If you have any preferences (e.g., include/exclude certain sections, emphasize specific biomarkers, or include image labels), tell me now and I will incorporate them.

Note
- This process does not provide clinical recommendations or treatment plans; it only compiles diagnostic and historical information into a formal report for review.
- Once all agents have contributed, I will summarize the findings and present the final document to you. Do you confirm the plan? If yes, I will initiate with PatientHistory for patient_4.
