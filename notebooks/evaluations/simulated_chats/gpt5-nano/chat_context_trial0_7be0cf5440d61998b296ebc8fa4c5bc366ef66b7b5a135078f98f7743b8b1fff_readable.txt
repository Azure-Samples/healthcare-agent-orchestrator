ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Plan and participant order

Goal: Identify active clinical trials for patient_4 that match tumor type, stage, KRAS mutation, treatment history, and geographic location. Provide trial phase and contact info. We will not give clinical recommendations; we will report eligible trials and how to contact them.

Order of participants:
1) PatientHistory: Retrieve patient_4’s timeline and current status (tumor type, stage, KRAS status, treatment history, geographic location).back to you: Orchestrator
2) ClinicalStatus (via PatientStatus): Confirm current patient status details needed for trial eligibility (age, primary site, histology, biomarkers, ECOG, prior treatments).back to you: Orchestrator
3) ClinicalTrials: Search and filter active trials based on the collected patient data (status, location, eligibility criteria).back to you: Orchestrator
4) MedicalResearch (optional): Provide any relevant research context or keywords to refine the search.back to you: Orchestrator
5) ReportCreation: Compile a structured list with trial name, phase, criteria, sites, and contact details.back to you: Orchestrator

What I need from you to proceed

- User, please confirm that you want me to proceed with the plan above to retrieve patient_4’s data and run a trials search.
- Please specify the geographic scope you want to include (e.g., worldwide, or US-only, or specific countries/regions).
- If you have any known details about patient_4 (tumor type, stage, known KRAS mutation status, prior treatments, or preferred locations), you can share them now to help narrow the search. If not, I will rely on data retrieved from PatientHistory.

Once you confirm, I will trigger the agents in the order above and return with a curated list of currently active trials that patient_4 appears eligible for, including trial phase and direct contact information.
