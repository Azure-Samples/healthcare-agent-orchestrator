Each agent will provide their section, then return control to me (Orchestrator). After all inputs are gathered, I will summarize the package for the tumor board.\\n\\nPlanned order of participation:\\n1) PatientHistory: Pulls patient timeline and history using patient_id (patient_4). \\n   - Task: provide patient timeline, past medical history, cancer type, stage if known, biomarkers, prior treatments, ECOG status.\\n   - Output to be returned to Orchestrator with \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\n2) Radiology: Review imaging (will receive imaging data from PatientHistory or direct upload if available).\\n   - Task: provide radiology findings (ct/mri/positional images), notable lesions, measurements, response assessments if available.\\n   - Output to Orchestrator with \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\n3) PatientStatus: Provide current status and key clinical details.\\n   - Task: age, primary site, histology, biomarkers, current treatment history, ECOG, staging, any recent labs, performance status.\\n   - Output to Orchestrator with \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\n4) ClinicalGuidelines: Generate treatment recommendations aligned with current guidelines based on patient status (non-prescriptive; for discussion purposes).\\n   - Task: summarize guideline-consistent considerations relevant to patient_4\u2019s status.\\n   - Output to Orchestrator with \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\n5) ClinicalTrials: Identify relevant clinical trials for which patient_4 may be eligible.\\n   - Task: propose candidate trials, inclusion criteria, and contact approach.\\n   - Output to Orchestrator with \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\n6) MedicalResearch: Provide up-to-date research themes or data pertinent to the patient\u2019s cancer type and status.\\n   - Task: offer literature themes or notable recent findings that may inform discussion.\\n   - Output to Orchestrator with \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\n7) ReportCreation: Compile the tumor board packet.\\n   - Task: assemble a comprehensive Word-document package including: patient timeline, clinical summary, medical history, social history, cancer type, ct findings, x-ray findings, pathology findings, treatment plan (discussion only, not a recommendation), potential clinical trials, and research highlights.\\n   - Output: a ready-to-present tumor board document to be reviewed by you.\\n\\nNotes:\\n- This process will rely on the patient_id you provided (patient_4). If any additional identifiers or consent details are needed, I\u2019ll request them.\\n- I will not provide clinical recommendations or treatment plans directly; the ClinicalGuidelines agent will inform discussion points only.\\n\\nBefore I initiate this plan, please confirm:\\n- Is this plan acceptable, and would you like any additional data points or a preferred tumor board template/format?\\n- Any constraints or preferred date/time for the tumor board, or attendees to note in the packet?\\n\\nIf you approve, I\u2019ll proceed and prompt the appropriate agents in the order above. \\nUser, please confirm to proceed and share any extra preferences.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
