If not, please confirm that I should retrieve the latest CT and CXR from the patient record for patient_4.\\n- If available, also share the date of the latest CT and the latest CXR (in case I need to verify which \u201clatest\u201d is intended).\\n\\nOnce you confirm and provide access to the images (or permission to retrieve them), I will:\\n1) Request from PatientHistory the latest CT and CXR images for patient_4 plus the current radiologist\u2019s report. back to you: Orchestrator\\n2) Have Radiology analyze the CT and CXR and return AI-generated findings. back to you: Orchestrator\\n3) Compare AI findings to the radiologist\u2019s report and summarize any discrepancies or additional findings. back to you: Orchestrator\\n4) Present a concise summary of discrepancies and any significant additions, and note any images or findings that may warrant further review. back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nWould you like me to proceed with retrieving/receiving the images now?\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
