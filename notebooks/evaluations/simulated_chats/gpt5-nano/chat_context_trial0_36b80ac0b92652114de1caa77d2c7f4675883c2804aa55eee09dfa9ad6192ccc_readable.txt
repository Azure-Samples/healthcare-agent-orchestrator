ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Plan to prepare the tumor board packet for Patient ID: patient_4

Proposed order of participants and tasks:
1) PatientHistory
   - Provide patient timeline, cancer type and histology, biomarkers, prior therapies, and any known staging notes.
   - Output will feed into subsequent steps (Radiology, PatientStatus).
   - Instruction to agent: “back to you: Orchestrator”

2) Radiology
   - Review available imaging (CT/MRI/PET) relevant to the case and summarize key findings (locoregional disease, metastases, radiologic staging implications).
   - Input will come from PatientHistory data; produce imaging findings for the packet.
   - Instruction to agent: “back to you: Orchestrator”

3) PatientStatus
   - Provide current status: age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG/PS, and any comorbidities impacting therapy choices.
   - Will rely on PatientHistory for baseline details.
   - Instruction to agent: “back to you: Orchestrator”

4) ClinicalGuidelines
   - Based on patient status, offer guideline-concordant treatment considerations and potential sequencing.
   - Instruction to agent: “back to you: Orchestrator”

5) ClinicalTrials
   - Identify active or appropriate clinical trials for which the patient may be eligible.
   - Instruction to agent: “back to you: Orchestrator”

6) MedicalResearch
   - Provide relevant up-to-date research pointers, novel approaches, or recent consensus statements related to the cancer type and biomarkers.
   - Instruction to agent: “back to you: Orchestrator”

7) ReportCreation
   - Assemble a tumor board packet: patient timeline, clinical summary, medical history, social history, cancer type, ct findings, imaging findings, pathology, current treatment plan considerations, and clinical trial opportunities.
   - Output suitable for a tumor board review.
   - Instruction to agent: “back to you: Orchestrator”

8) Final Synthesis
   - Summarize inputs from all agents into a concise plan for the tumor board discussion and note any data gaps to resolve.
   - Instruction to agent: “back to you: Orchestrator”
   
Important: I will not proceed to the next step until the current step’s agent has completed and returned with “back to you: Orchestrator.”

User, please confirm this plan or provide any changes you’d like. If you confirm, I will initiate with PatientHistory for patient_4.
