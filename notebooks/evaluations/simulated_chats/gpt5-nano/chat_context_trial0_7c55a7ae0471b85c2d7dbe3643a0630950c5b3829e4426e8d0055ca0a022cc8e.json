Please confirm:\\n  - Do you want me to pull the necessary data from the system for patient_4 (via PatientHistory) using the patient ID you\u2019ve provided, or would you like to provide the details directly?\\n- If you provide yourself, please include:\\n  - Tumor type (e.g., NSCLC, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, etc.)\\n  - Cancer stage (e.g., Stage IIIb, Stage IV, etc.)\\n  - KRAS mutation status (mutant/wild-type, specific mutation if known)\\n  - Treatment history (prior lines, regimens, last treatment date)\\n  - Geographic location (country and, if possible, region/ccity)\\n  - Any location constraints (e.g., trials only in the US, Europe, or a specific country)\\n  - Any trial phase preference (Phase 1/2/3/4) or exclude certain types\\n- If you\u2019d rather I pull automatically: say \u201cPull from system for patient_4\u201d and I\u2019ll proceed with the data extraction.\\n\\nNext step plan (pending your confirmation)\\n- Upon your confirmation, I will:\\n  1) Ask PatientHistory to proceed with patient_4 data. back to you: Orchestrator\\n  2) Use the retrieved data in PatientStatus to confirm current status. back to you: Orchestrator\\n  3) Query ClinicalTrials for active trials matching tumor type, stage, KRAS status, prior therapies, and geographic location. back to you: Orchestrator\\n  4) Present a list of eligible trials with trial phase and contact information. back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nPlease confirm the plan and provide the necessary details (or authorize pulling from the system for patient_4).
