Produce a concise clinical history, key events, prior diagnoses, treatments, and relevant social history.\\n\\n2) Radiology\\n   - Task: Review and summarize radiology findings using imaging data provided by PatientHistory (e.g., CT, chest X-ray). Provide imaging-based findings, notable lesions, staging-relevant features.\\n\\n3) PatientStatus\\n   - Task: Provide the current status of the patient (age, primary site, histology, biomarkers, TNM/staging if known, ECOG/PS, treatment history, current medications, allergies, and any prior interventions). Draw from the PatientHistory input.\\n\\n4) ClinicalGuidelines\\n   - Task: Based on the PatientStatus information, outline guideline-concordant considerations and potential therapeutic options to discuss at the tumor board (not a treatment plan\u2014just guideline-aligned considerations).\\n\\n5) ClinicalTrials\\n   - Task: Identify relevant ongoing clinical trials for which patient_4 might be eligible, given the current status and prior treatments. Provide trial options, inclusion/exclusion notes, and geographical/eligibility considerations.\\n\\n6) MedicalResearch\\n   - Task: Provide up-to-date research context related to the patient\u2019s cancer type, histology, and any notable biomarkers or mutations. Offer high-level research considerations or questions to discuss at the board.\\n\\n7) ReportCreation\\n   - Task: Assemble a tumor board-ready document with:\\n     - Patient timeline and clinical summary\\n     - Medical history and social history\\n     - Cancer type, histology, biomarkers\\n     - CT/X-ray findings\\n     - Pathology findings (as available)\\n     - Summary of current status and prior treatments\\n     - Proposed discussion points (from guidelines and trials)\\n     - Relevant clinical trials and research notes\\n     - Any requested documents (and planned next steps)\\n\\nNote: If at any step data is missing, I will pause and query you for specifics or request the necessary data from the appropriate agent.\\n\\nUser confirmation needed\\nPlease confirm that you\u2019d like me to proceed with this plan and to initiate data gathering for patient_4 in the order listed above. Also tell me if you have any preferences or additional focus areas (for example: emphasis on a specific biomarker, prior surgical notes, social determinants of health, goals of care, etc.). \\n\\nIf you approve, I\u2019ll begin by engaging PatientHistory and proceed through the sequence, updating you after each step.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
