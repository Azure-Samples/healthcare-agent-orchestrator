It is approved in certain settings for KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC after prior therapy (the exact staging and line of therapy can vary by region and label updates).\\n  - The rationale is to directly inhibit the mutant KRAS G12C protein, which may slow tumor growth and/or shrink tumors in some patients.\\n\\n- Potential benefits (as observed in studies with KRAS G12C inhibitors, general expectations)\\n  - Objective tumor responses (tumor shrinkage) in a subset of patients.\\n  - Disease control in a larger subset (including stable disease) and potential delay in progression.\\n  - For responders, duration of response can last several months; some patients may experience longer benefit.\\n  - Potential improvement in symptoms and quality of life for those whose tumors shrink or stabilize.\\n\\n- Potential risks and downsides\\n  - Common adverse effects: gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, nausea, vomiting), fatigue, liver enzyme elevations, and decreased appetite.\\n  - Other possible adverse effects: cough, dyspnea, rash, and, less commonly, interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis; QTc prolongation can occur with some targeted therapies.\\n  - Drug\u2013drug interactions (notably with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers); considerations for hepatic or renal impairment.\\n  - Not all patients respond; even among responders, resistance can develop over time.\\n  - It is usually not curative; progression can occur after stopping or during therapy.\\n\\n- How this might change prognosis (conceptual, not personalized without patient data)\\n  - For eligible patients, KRAS G12C-directed therapy can meaningfully extend the time to progression for some and provide tumor control where conventional chemotherapy or immunotherapy alone might have limited activity.\\n  - Improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rates have been observed in trials, but these results are not uniformly predictive for every patient or across all disease settings.\\n  - Overall survival (OS) benefits are less clearly defined in single-arm trials and depend on many factors (prior therapies, tumor biology, comorbidities, and subsequent treatments).\\n  - Prognosis also depends on tumor burden, performance status, coexisting molecular alterations, and whether the patient has had prior effective therapies (e.g., immunotherapy, chemotherapy).\\n\\nPlease provide:\\n- The patient ID to access the history.\\n- Any known details you want me to consider (cancer type, stage, prior lines of therapy, ECOG status, current labs, hepatic/renal function, concomitant medications).\\n\\nOnce you provide the ID, I\u2019ll proceed to gather inputs from the agents in the planned order and then summarize the evidence on benefits, risks, and potential prognosis impact in the context of this patient.

Below is a concise synthesis of clinical evidence and considerations related to KRAS p.G12C inhibitors, focusing on adagrasib vs sotorasib, resistance patterns, and co-mutations.\\n\\nClinical evidence overview (KRAS G12C inhibitors, general, non-personalized)\\n- Drugs in this class:\\n  - Sotorasib (AMG510)\\n  - Adagrasib (MRTX849)\\n- Evidence basis:\\n  - Both agents have demonstrated clinically meaningful activity in KRAS G12C-mutant cancers, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), after prior therapy in single-arm phase 2 trials.\\n  - Direct head-to-head comparisons between adagrasib and sotorasib have not been published; cross-trial comparisons are limited by differences in patient populations, lines of therapy, and trial design.\\n- Typical efficacy signals (range-based, non-patient-specific):\\n  - Objective response rates (ORR): generally in the approximate range of the high 20s to low/mid 40s percent for NSCLC cohorts; exact numbers vary by trial and population.\\n  - Duration of response (DoR): responses tend to last months (often several months, with medians commonly in the 6\u20139 month range in reported NSCLC cohorts).\\n  - Disease control: a substantial proportion of patients achieve stable disease in addition to responders.\\n  - Progression-free survival (PFS): typically in the several-month range in early-phase data; OS signals are less consistently mature and vary by study population and subsequent therapies.\\n- Safety/tolerability (common, non-personalized):\\n  - Gastrointestinal symptoms: diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.\\n  - Fatigue, decreased appetite.\\n  - Liver enzyme elevations (ALT/AST) and potential liver function impact.\\n  - Other: cough, dyspnea, rash; rare interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis; QTc prolongation (monitoring may be advised with some regimens).\\n  - Drug\u2013drug interactions: notable with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers; consider hepatic/renal function when applying real-world regimens.\\n  - Not all patients respond; primary resistance and acquired resistance can occur.\\n- Co-mutations and biology (contextual considerations):\\n  - STK11 and KEAP1 co-mutations are relatively common in KRAS-mutant NSCLC and are often discussed as markers of poorer prognosis with immunotherapy; their impact on KRAS G12C inhibitors is less clearly defined.\\n  - Some analyses suggest co-mutations may influence duration of response or durability, but definitive predictive value for KRAS G12C inhibitors is not established.\\n- Resistance mechanisms (conceptual overview):\\n  - On-target or pathway reactivation: secondary mutations or alterations that reactivate the MAPK pathway.\\n  - Parallel pathway activation: upregulation of RTKs or activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways (e.g., MET amplification, EGFR signaling).\\n  - Tumor microenvironment changes and histologic evolution can contribute to resistance.\\n  - Emergence of KRAS mutations other than G12C (or compensatory KRAS signaling) reducing inhibitor binding/inhibition efficacy.\\n  - Resistance can be context-specific and may differ across tumor types and prior therapies.\\n- Practical implications and prognosis context (non-personalized):\\n  - In eligible patients, KRAS G12C inhibitors can meaningfully extend time to progression and provide disease control for a subset, potentially translating to symptom benefit and improved quality of life for those who respond or stabilize.\\n  - Overall survival benefits are variable and influenced by prior therapies, tumor biology, comorbidities, and access to subsequent therapies.\\n  - Brain metastases and CNS disease status, prior immunotherapy exposure, and performance status can influence outcomes but are not deterministic.\\n\\nQuestion answered:\\n- What is the clinical evidence supporting use of KRAS inhibitors (adagrasib vs sotorasib) in KRAS p.G12C-mutant cancers, and what about resistance patterns or co-mutations (e.g., STK11, KEAP1) affecting efficacy?\\n  - Evidence: Both adagrasib and sotorasib show clinically meaningful activity in KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC after prior therapy in phase 2 trials; no published head-to-head comparison exists to declare a superior option. Cross-trial comparisons are limited due to design and population differences.\\n  - Resistance patterns: reactivation of MAPK signaling, activation of parallel RTK pathways (e.g., MET, EGFR/HER2), and other adaptive mechanisms can contribute to resistance. Co-mutations like STK11 and KEAP1 may influence overall outcomes in KRAS-mutant cancers, but their exact predictive value for KRAS G12C inhibitors is not definitively established.\\n  - Implications: Both agents offer non-curative disease control in a subset of patients; durability varies and resistance is expected to emerge in many cases. Selection may be influenced by prior therapies and tumor biology, and ongoing research is exploring combination strategies to address resistance.\\n\\nNext steps (based on your current preference)\\n- If you\u2019d like, I can attempt another targeted evidence pull (Option A: patient-specific sequence) once you provide the patient ID.\\n- Or, I can continue with additional general information topics (e.g., potential combination strategies being studied, biomarkers to watch, or trial options) in the general overview frame.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you want me to proceed with:\\n- Option A (provide patient ID to start patient-specific sequencing), or\\n- Option B (continue with general, non-patient-specific information and potential next topics).\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
