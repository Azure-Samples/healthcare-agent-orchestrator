Now, I need your confirmation to proceed and any special constraints.\\n\\nWhat I need from you, User\\n- Please confirm that you want me to proceed with the data-gathering plan above for patient_4.\\n- Are there any specific time window or sources to include/exclude (e.g., only data within last 24 months, include external lab reports, include AI-generated outputs only if clearly labeled as such)?\\n- If you have any additional context (e.g., known recent EMR edits, ongoing re-staging, or active clinical trials) share it to tailor the review.\\n\\nIf you confirm, I will prompt the agents in the following order:\\n- PatientHistory: proceed with EMR notes, timeline, and any pathology notes for patient_4. back to you: Orchestrator\\n- Radiology: proceed with imaging reports and AI imaging outputs for patient_4. back to you: Orchestrator\\n- MedicalResearch: proceed with biomarker reports and AI-generated biomarker outputs for patient_4. back to you: Orchestrator\\n- PatientStatus: proceed with current status (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG) as available from PatientHistory. back to you: Orchestrator\\n- After those, I\u2019ll synthesize the inconsistencies and present a flagged summary for your review.\\n\\nWould you like me to proceed?\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
