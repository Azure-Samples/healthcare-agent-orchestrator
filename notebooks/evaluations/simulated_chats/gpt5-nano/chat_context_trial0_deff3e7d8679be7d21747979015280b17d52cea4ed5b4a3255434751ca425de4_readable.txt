ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Plan to prepare a tumor board package for Patient ID: patient_4

Plan and order of participants (each agent will, after completing their task, yield back to you: "back to you: Orchestrator")

1) PatientHistory (get patient timeline and history)
- What you can expect: baseline demographics, cancer history, prior treatments, comorbidities, smoking status, performance status notes, and any relevant social history.
- Needed to proceed: patient_4 (provided as Patient ID).

2) Radiology (review imaging)
- What you can expect: radiology insights from CT/MRI/PET images, chest X-ray findings, notable lesions, progression, response to therapy.

3) PatientStatus (current status summary)
- What you can expect: age, primary site, histology, biomarkers, cancer staging, ECOG/PS, current treatment history, and key lab data.

4) ClinicalGuidelines (treatment considerations)
- What you can expect: guidance aligned with current guidelines based on PatientStatus data (not a clinical plan from me, but guidance from the Guidelines agent).

5) ClinicalTrials (clinical trial options)
- What you can expect: available trials relevant to the patient’s status and disease characteristics.

6) MedicalResearch (contextual research info)
- What you can expect: recent research topics or findings related to the patient’s cancer type and treatments being considered.

7) ReportCreation (tumor board document)
- What you can expect: a tumor board-ready document including patient timeline, clinical summary, medical/social history, cancer type, imaging findings (CT, X-ray), pathology highlights, treatment history, proposed discussion points, and clinical trial options.

User confirmation needed
- Please confirm that you want me to proceed with the plan above to assemble the tumor board package for patient_4. If you have any changes (e.g., include pathology slides, genetic/biomarker reports, additional imaging, or preferred document format), tell me now and I’ll adjust.

User, please confirm to proceed with this plan. If you confirm, I’ll initiate with the PatientHistory agent for patient_4 and proceed through the sequence, ensuring each agent yields back to you: “back to you: Orchestrator” after their input.
