ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Plan to generate the diagnostic summary for Patient ID: patient_4 and export as a formatted Word document for tumor board:

Order of participants and purpose:
- PatientHistory: Retrieve the patient timeline and clinical history for patient_4 (biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history) and provide any available imaging references. back to you: Orchestrator
- Radiology: Provide radiology insights and latest imaging findings (CT/MRI/PET) associated with patient_4. back to you: Orchestrator
- PatientStatus: Compile current status, including age, primary site, histology, biomarkers, staging, ECOG, and treatment history, from the patient data. back to you: Orchestrator
- ReportCreation: Create a comprehensive diagnostic summary document formatted for tumor board, including sections for timeline, clinical summary, medical history, social history, cancer type, CT findings, imaging findings, pathology findings, treatment history, and clinical trials. Export as a Word document. back to you: Orchestrator

What I need from you to proceed:
- Please confirm that you want me to proceed with the plan above for Patient ID: patient_4.
- If you have any specific formatting preferences or sections you want emphasized in the tumor board report (e.g., emphasis on biomarker status, staging nuances, or particular imaging findings), tell me now and I’ll incorporate them.

Notes:
- I will not provide clinical recommendations or treatment plans; this workflow is focused on creating a comprehensive diagnostic summary and an exportable Word document for tumor board review.
- If any information is missing or requires clarifications, I will work with the designated agents to fill gaps and then return the compiled document for your review.

Please confirm to proceed, or let me know if you’d like to adjust the plan (e.g., include clinical trials status explicitly, or add an executive summary at the top).
