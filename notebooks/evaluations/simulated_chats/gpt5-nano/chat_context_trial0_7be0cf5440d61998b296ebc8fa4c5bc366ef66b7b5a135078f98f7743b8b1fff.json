If not, I will rely on data retrieved from PatientHistory.\\n\\nOnce you confirm, I will trigger the agents in the order above and return with a curated list of currently active trials that patient_4 appears eligible for, including trial phase and direct contact information.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
