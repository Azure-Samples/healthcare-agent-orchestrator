ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Plan to generate a comprehensive diagnostic summary for Patient ID: patient_4 and export as a formatted Word document for tumor board:

Proposed workflow and order of participants
- You will be involved throughout. The following agents will be engaged in sequence to gather data and assemble the report:
  1) PatientHistory: Retrieve patient timeline, demographics, cancer type, histology, biomarker status, stage at initial diagnosis, and treatment history. After responding, the agent will yield back to you: "back to you: Orchestrator".
  2) PatientStatus: Provide current patient status (age, current staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, ECOG status, and updated treatment history). After responding, the agent will yield back to you: "back to you: Orchestrator".
  3) Radiology: Provide latest imaging findings (e.g., CT/MRI/PET) with dates and key impressions relevant to staging and response. After responding, the agent will yield back to you: "back to you: Orchestrator".
  4) ClinicalGuidelines: (Optional) Align diagnostic summary with relevant guidelines; summarize any guideline-relevant considerations. After responding, the agent will yield back to you: "back to you: Orchestrator".
  5) ClinicalTrials: (Optional) Identify any ongoing or relevant trials that fit the patientâ€™s status for discussion. After responding, the agent will yield back to you: "back to you: Orchestrator".
  6) MedicalResearch: (Optional) Provide current research context related to biomarkers or treatments applicable to this patient. After responding, the agent will yield back to you: "back to you: Orchestrator".
  7) ReportCreation: Synthesize all collected data into a formatted Word document suitable for tumor board, including sections for timeline, clinical summary, medical history, social history, cancer type, imaging findings, pathology findings, biomarker status, staging, treatment history, treatment plan (for discussion), and any relevant clinical trials or research notes. After responding, the agent will yield back to you: "back to you: Orchestrator".

- Output: A formatted Word document (.docx) ready for tumor board presentation.

What I need from you to proceed
- Confirmation to execute the above plan to generate and export the diagnostic summary as a Word document.
- Any preferences for document formatting or sections (e.g., include embedded imaging, include pathology images, preferred section order).
- Any constraints or templates you want followed (e.g., hospital template, specific wording for headings).
- Optional: Indicate whether you want me to include related clinical trials and current research discussion in the report.

Optional but helpful clarifications
- Do you want the Word document to embed imaging screenshots or only include imaging findings text (impression, dates, modality)?
- Do you want the document to strictly cover diagnostic summary or also include a concise treatment plan/considerations for tumor board discussion?

Please confirm to proceed with the plan. If you confirm, I will initiate data retrieval from the agents in the order above and return with the assembled Word document as soon as all inputs are gathered. 

Note: This plan adheres to the guideline that each agent, after completing their task, should yield the chat back to you: "back to you: Orchestrator" after their response.
