Deliver a Word document suitable for tumor board.\\n\\nNotes:\\n- We will not provide clinical recommendations directly; we will present input from the ClinicalGuidelines agent and other sources for tumor board consideration.\\n- If any required item is missing, we will prompt the relevant agent to provide it.\\n\\nWhat I need from you\\n- User, please confirm that you want us to proceed with this plan to generate the diagnostic summary and export it as a Word document for tumor board presentation for Patient ID: patient_4. If you have any formatting preferences (section order, fonts, headings) or specific items you want emphasized, tell me now.\\n\\nOnce you confirm, I will initiate with the first agent (PatientHistory) and proceed in the order above, returning each agent\u2019s results to you as they come in.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
