Provide radiology insights and summarize ct/scan findings.\\n- Rationale: Imaging findings are essential for staging and evaluating response or progression.\\n- Output to expect: imaging findings and interpretation.\\n\\n3) PatientStatus\\n- Task: Compile current patient status using data from PatientHistory (age, primary site, histology, biomarkers, ECOG status, current treatments, prior lines of therapy, staging).\\n- Rationale: Gives a concise snapshot for decision-making.\\n- Output to expect: current status summary.\\n\\n4) ClinicalGuidelines\\n- Task: Provide evidence-based treatment recommendations aligned with the patient\u2019s status.\\n- Rationale: Helps frame options in the context of guidelines.\\n- Output to expect: treatment recommendations (note: this will be presented as guidance, not a clinical plan).\\n\\n5) ClinicalTrials\\n- Task: Identify and summarize relevant clinical trials matching the patient\u2019s status.\\n- Rationale: Explore trial options that may be appropriate.\\n- Output to expect: list of applicable trials with eligibility notes.\\n\\n6) MedicalResearch\\n- Task: Provide recent research and literature related to the patient\u2019s cancer type, biomarker(s), or treatment plan.\\n- Rationale: Contextualizes options with current evidence.\\n- Output to expect: short literature summary and key takeaways.\\n\\n7) ReportCreation\\n- Task: Assemble a comprehensive tumor board document (timeline, clinical summary, medical history, social history, cancer type, imaging findings, pathology findings, current treatment plan, and potential clinical trials).\\n- Rationale: Produce a board-ready document for discussion.\\n- Output to expect: a complete tumor board report.\\n\\nWhat I need from you to begin:\\n- Confirm that you approve proceeding with this plan for patient_4.\\n- Are there any special focal points you want the board to emphasize (e.g., recurrence risk, biomarker-directed therapy, eligibility for specific trials, quality of life considerations)?\\n- If you have any available documents or data you want included now (recent imaging, pathology reports, labs, ECOG status, etc.), please provide or specify where I can access them.\\n\\nUser, please confirm the plan and provide any additional instructions or data you want included.
