Here is the proposed plan and order of participants:\\n\\n1) PatientHistory \u2014 retrieve and present the patient timeline and source data (age, primary site, histology, stage at diagnosis, biomarkers, pathology reports, treatment history, prior imaging reports). PatientHistory will provide the raw inputs we need. (Needed: patient ID \u2014 you provided patient_4 \u2014 and any additional source documents you have.)\\n\\n2) PatientStatus \u2014 synthesize current status from the PatientHistory output (current stage, ECOG, summary of biomarker status, treatment response, active issues). (Needs: the PatientHistory output.)\\n\\n3) Radiology \u2014 provide the latest imaging findings and impressions (CT, PET, X-ray). (Needs: image files or the most recent radiology report(s); can also interpret uploaded images if provided.)\\n\\n4) ReportCreation \u2014 assemble a formatted Word (.docx) tumor board document containing: patient timeline, clinical summary, medical and social history, cancer type, pathology findings, biomarker status, staging at diagnosis, treatment history, current clinical status, latest imaging findings (with images if provided), and recommended slides/appendix for tumor board. (Needs: patient timeline, PatientStatus summary, Radiology findings, pathology excerpts.)\\n\\nI will moderate each step, ensure agents ask for any missing information, and collect their outputs. Each agent, after completing their task, should yield the chat back to me by ending their response with:\\nback to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nActions I need from you now, User\\n- *User*, please confirm that I should proceed with the above plan for Patient ID: patient_4.\\n- *User*, do you have any of the following to upload or paste now? If so, please provide them:\\n  - Recent radiology images (CT, PET, X-ray) or the most recent radiology report(s)\\n  - Pathology report(s) including biomarker testing results (eg, IHC, FISH, NGS)\\n  - Any clinical notes summarizing recent visits, ECOG performance status, or treatment responses\\n  - Any tumor board presentation template or institutional header/footer to include in the Word doc\\n- *User*, do you want the Word document to include patient identifiers (full name, MRN) or be de-identified for external distribution?\\n\\nIf you confirm and/or upload reports/images, I will start by asking PatientHistory to retrieve the patient's timeline and required data.\\n\\nPatientHistory, proceed with patient_4\\n- Please provide: patient age, sex, primary cancer site, histology, stage at diagnosis (TNM and overall stage if available), biomarker status (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, PD-L1 %, HER2, BRAF, MSI, etc. \u2014 list what's available), full treatment history (dates, agents, surgeries, radiotherapy), ECOG performance status, key comorbidities, recent lab summary if available, and copies/excerpts of pathology and radiology reports. Also list any missing items you cannot find.\\n- After your response, end with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nPlease confirm you want me to proceed now and upload any documents you have.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
