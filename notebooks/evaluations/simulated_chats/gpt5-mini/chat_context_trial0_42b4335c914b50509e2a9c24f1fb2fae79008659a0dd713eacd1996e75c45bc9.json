PatientHistory \u2014 to retrieve the patient timeline, pathology, biomarker results, staging at diagnosis, treatment history, ECOG, comorbidities and any available imaging reports. (Needed first because other agents depend on these data.)\\n  2. Radiology \u2014 to analyze any imaging (CT, PET, X-ray) or imaging reports supplied and provide imaging findings and measurement comparisons. (Needs images or reports obtained from PatientHistory or the user.)\\n  3. PatientStatus \u2014 to synthesize current status (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG). (Depends on PatientHistory and Radiology.)\\n  4. ReportCreation \u2014 to compile the Word document suitable for tumor board presentation (requires patient timeline, clinical summary, medical and social history, imaging findings, pathology, treatment plan and any trial options). (Final assembly step.)\\n- After each agent's response they must yield back to me with the phrase: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nImportant notes and constraints\\n- I will moderate the discussion and gather data; I will not give clinical recommendations or treatment plans. ReportCreation will format the document but will not itself recommend therapy.\\n- If any information is missing, I will prompt the appropriate agent or ask you (User) for the missing items.\\n- To produce a Word document, ReportCreation will need the full set of inputs (see below).\\n\\nWhat I need from you, User, before we start\\nUser, can you provide the following for Patient ID: patient_4?\\n1. Confirm that patient_4 is the correct patient ID to work with and whether we should de-identify the report for external distribution.\\n2. Pathology report(s) (PDF or text) \u2014 including histology, grade, path stage, and biomarker panel (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, PD-L1 %, MSI, HER2, NGS report if available).\\n3. Staging at diagnosis (clinical and/or pathologic TNM and overall stage) if known.\\n4. Comprehensive treatment history (dates and names of systemic therapies, radiotherapy, surgeries \u2014 include start/stop dates and response assessments if available).\\n5. Latest imaging studies and reports (CT chest/abdomen/pelvis, PET-CT, MRI) \u2014 either as DICOM files or PDF reports and the date of the study. If you have the actual images for radiologic review, please upload them; if not, provide the radiology report(s).\\n6. Current ECOG performance status, age, primary site, and relevant comorbidities.\\n7. Any specific tumor board template/header or institutional formatting requirements for the Word document, and the desired filename.\\n8. Deadline for when you need the Word document.\\n\\nIf you cannot provide full documents, provide what you have \u2014 the agents will work with whatever is available.\\n\\nNow I will call the first agent.\\n\\nPatientHistory, proceed with retrieval for patient_4\\n- Task: Provide a comprehensive patient timeline and available data for Patient ID: patient_4. Specifically provide:\\n  - Date of diagnosis, primary site, histology, grade\\n  - Biomarker status (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, PD-L1 %, MSI, NGS summary)\\n  - Stage at diagnosis (clinical and/or pathologic TNM and overall stage)\\n  - Treatment history with dates (surgery, radiation, systemic therapies, clinical trials)\\n  - ECOG performance status and relevant comorbidities\\n  - Latest available imaging reports (dates and brief summaries) and pathology reports\\n- If any of these items are not in the record, explicitly list what is missing.\\n- After completing your response, include: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nPatientHistory, you may ask me or the User if you require further clarifications.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
