PatientHistory \u2014 provide patient_4 timeline and list available imaging studies (dates, image types) and supply the radiologist\u2019s report if available.\\n  2. Radiology \u2014 state what image files and metadata are needed, then analyze the CT and CXR images with the imaging tool and produce AI-generated findings.\\n  3. Radiology \u2014 compare the AI-generated findings to the radiologist\u2019s report and summarize discrepancies/additional findings.\\n  4. Orchestrator (me) \u2014 summarize the results and ask the user if they want any follow-up.\\n- Important rule: After completing their task, each agent should yield the chat back to me and explicitly say: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n\\nImmediate requests (what I need from you and the agents)\\n- User, please provide:\\n  1. The CT and CXR images for patient_4 (DICOM preferred; if not possible, high-resolution JPEG/PNG). If there are multiple studies, indicate which is the \\\"latest\\\" or provide dates.\\n  2. The radiologist\u2019s written report(s) for those imaging studies.\\n  3. Confirm that the patient ID is patient_4 and provide the dates of the CT and CXR studies if available.\\n\\n- PatientHistory, proceed with patient_4:\\n  - Please provide the patient timeline and list of available imaging studies (study types and dates) and attach any available radiology report(s) for those studies.\\n  - After your response, say: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\n- Radiology, before analysis:\\n  - What exact image formats, viewing access, and any metadata (contrast phase, slice thickness, window settings, series to prioritize) do you need to run the imaging tool analysis and produce AI-generated findings and a comparison to the radiologist\u2019s report?\\n  - Confirm you will perform: (a) AI-based image analysis, (b) extraction of AI findings, and (c) side-by-side comparison with the radiologist\u2019s report once images and the report are available.\\n  - After your response, say: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nPlease provide the items asked of you (User) so PatientHistory and Radiology can proceed.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
