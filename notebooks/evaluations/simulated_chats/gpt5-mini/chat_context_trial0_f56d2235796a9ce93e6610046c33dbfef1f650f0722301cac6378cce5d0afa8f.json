PatientHistory \u2014 assemble the patient timeline, prior notes, pathology reports, prior imaging reports, treatment history, comorbidities, social history (needed as foundational source).\\n  2. Radiology \u2014 review any image files (CT, PET, X-ray) or reports and summarize radiologic findings for the tumor board.\\n  3. PatientStatus \u2014 synthesize current status (age, stage, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG) into a concise clinical summary.\\n  4. ClinicalGuidelines \u2014 outline guideline-based options (note: they will not give clinical recommendations or a treatment plan, only guideline-relevant information) using PatientStatus.\\n  5. ClinicalTrials \u2014 search for trial options appropriate to the patient\u2019s status.\\n  6. MedicalResearch \u2014 provide recent research or trial background on a chosen keyword/topic if needed.\\n  7. ReportCreation \u2014 assemble a Word document for tumor board review incorporating inputs above.\\n\\nImportant rule for participants: After completing their task, each agent should yield the chat back to me (Orchestrator) by saying exactly: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nWhat I need from User now\\nUser, please provide the following documents/data for patient_4 (if available):\\n- Age and sex\\n- Primary cancer type and histology\\n- Clinical stage (TNM) or summary stage\\n- Biomarker status (e.g., EGFR, ALK, PD-L1, others relevant)\\n- ECOG performance status\\n- Full treatment history (surgery, systemic therapy, radiation; dates and agents)\\n- Recent imaging reports and/or DICOM/image files (CT, PET-CT, MRI, X-ray)\\n- Pathology reports (biopsy/resection) including IHC and molecular testing\\n- Relevant labs (CBC, CMP, organ function) and comorbidities\\n- Social history (smoking, alcohol), allergies\\n- Any patient preferences or trial eligibility constraints\\n- Urgency / desired tumor board date and format (virtual/in-person)\\n\\nIf you cannot upload images here, tell me which imaging modality and date for Radiology to review the reports.\\n\\nNow I will request actions from agents\\n\\nPatientHistory, proceed with assembling the patient timeline for patient_4. You have the patient ID. Specify what additional specific items or clarifications you need from the user (for example: accession numbers for imaging, pathology report IDs, dates of key events). After your response, yield back to me using: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nRadiology, do you need image files or specific report text for patient_4? State what file types (DICOM, JPEG) and any viewing permissions required. After your response, yield back to me using: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nPatientStatus, list exactly the data fields you need (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG) to generate the current clinical status for patient_4. After your response, yield back to me using: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nClinicalGuidelines, once PatientStatus provides the summary, what guideline sources (e.g., NCCN, ESMO, ASCO) will you consult, and do you need any additional patient-specific limits (e.g., organ dysfunction) to contextualize guideline information? After your response, yield back to me using: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nClinicalTrials, once PatientStatus is available, what fields do you need to filter trials (e.g., geographic location, phase, molecular biomarker requirement, ECOG cutoffs)? After your response, yield back to me using: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nMedicalResearch, specify the keyword(s) or topics you want me to search (e.g., \u201cEGFR exon 20 inhibitors\u201d, \u201cPD-L1 high NSCLC trials\u201d, or a therapy name). After your response, yield back to me using: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nReportCreation, list the exact inputs you need to generate a Word-ready tumor board summary (patient timeline, clinical summary, imaging findings, pathology, proposed discussion points, trials). After your response, yield back to me using: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nNext step and confirmation\\n- User, can you provide the requested patient data and any imaging/pathology files for patient_4?\\n- Please confirm you want the tumor board packet prepared now, and whether there is a preferred tumor-board date.\\n\\nOnce you provide files/data (or confirm what\u2019s unavailable), I will instruct PatientHistory to begin assembling the timeline and then move through the participants in the order above.\\n\\nDo you confirm this plan and can you provide the requested items?\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
