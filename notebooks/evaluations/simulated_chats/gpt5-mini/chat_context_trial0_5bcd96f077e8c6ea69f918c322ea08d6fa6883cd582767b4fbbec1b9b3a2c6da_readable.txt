Generate a comprehensive diagnostic summary for Patient ID: patient_4 including biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, and latest imaging findings. Export the report as a formatted Word document for tumor board presentation.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Plan and participant order

I will coordinate the team to create a comprehensive diagnostic summary and then produce a formatted Word document suitable for tumor board presentation. Proposed order of contributors and rationale:
1. PatientHistory — to provide the patient timeline, pathology, biomarkers, staging at diagnosis, treatment history, social/medical history, and any image references.
2. PatientStatus — to synthesize current patient status (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG) from PatientHistory.
3. Radiology — to provide the latest imaging findings (CT, MRI, X-ray). Radiology will need image files or image reports; PatientHistory should supply those or reference them.
4. ClinicalTrials — to list appropriate clinical trials matching the patient status (optional but useful for tumor board).
5. ReportCreation — to assemble the tumor-board-ready Word document using the collected timeline, clinical summary, medical history, imaging and pathology findings, treatment history, and clinical trials listing.

Important rule to follow: After each agent completes their task, they should yield the chat back to me (Orchestrator) by ending their reply with: back to you: Orchestrator

User confirmation
User, may I proceed with this plan to retrieve and synthesize the record for patient_4? Please confirm. If you want any additional sections included in the report (e.g., multidisciplinary recommendations, specific imaging sequences, or certain trial types), mention them now.

Requests to agents
PatientHistory, proceed with patient ID: patient_4. Please provide:
- Complete patient timeline relevant to the cancer episode (dates of diagnosis, staging, major events)
- Primary site and histology
- Biomarker results (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, PD-L1, BRAF, MSI, others if available)
- Stage at diagnosis (include TNM if available)
- Treatment history (surgery, chemo, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, radiation — include dates and responses)
- Latest pathology report summary
- Latest imaging reports or image files (CT/MRI/PET/X-ray) or links — clearly label the latest study and date
- Relevant past medical history and social history (smoking, performance status if available)
- Any notes about ongoing clinical issues or comorbidities

PatientHistory, what (if anything) do you need from the User to complete this? If you can proceed with patient_4, please provide the requested details. Then end with: back to you: Orchestrator

Once PatientHistory responds, I will call PatientStatus to synthesize the current status, then Radiology for imaging interpretation, then ClinicalTrials (if desired), and finally ReportCreation to export the Word document.

Please confirm you want me to proceed, User, and PatientHistory please begin with patient_4.
