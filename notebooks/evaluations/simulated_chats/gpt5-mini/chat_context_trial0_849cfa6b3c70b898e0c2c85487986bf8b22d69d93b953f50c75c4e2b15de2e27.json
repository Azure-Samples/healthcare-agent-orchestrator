List any missing metadata (study dates, accession numbers) required.\\n\\nRadiology, before you analyze: what file formats and accompanying data do you need (DICOM series, window/level presets, prior studies for comparison) to run the imaging tool and produce AI findings and the comparison to the radiologist\u2019s report?\\n\\nPlease respond with the items you need. Once the user supplies the images and report (and grants permission), PatientHistory should supply/confirm the available files and Radiology will proceed with the imaging analysis.\\n\\nDo you confirm this plan, User, and can you upload the images and the radiologist\u2019s report now?\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
