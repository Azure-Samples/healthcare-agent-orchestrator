ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Plan and order of participants
- Purpose: Analyze the latest CT and CXR images for patient_4 using the imaging tool, generate AI-based imaging findings, compare those findings to the radiologist’s report, and summarize discrepancies or additional findings.
- Order of participants and roles:
  1. PatientHistory — provide patient_4 timeline and list available imaging studies (dates, image types) and supply the radiologist’s report if available.
  2. Radiology — state what image files and metadata are needed, then analyze the CT and CXR images with the imaging tool and produce AI-generated findings.
  3. Radiology — compare the AI-generated findings to the radiologist’s report and summarize discrepancies/additional findings.
  4. Orchestrator (me) — summarize the results and ask the user if they want any follow-up.
- Important rule: After completing their task, each agent should yield the chat back to me and explicitly say: "back to you: Orchestrator".

Immediate requests (what I need from you and the agents)
- User, please provide:
  1. The CT and CXR images for patient_4 (DICOM preferred; if not possible, high-resolution JPEG/PNG). If there are multiple studies, indicate which is the "latest" or provide dates.
  2. The radiologist’s written report(s) for those imaging studies.
  3. Confirm that the patient ID is patient_4 and provide the dates of the CT and CXR studies if available.

- PatientHistory, proceed with patient_4:
  - Please provide the patient timeline and list of available imaging studies (study types and dates) and attach any available radiology report(s) for those studies.
  - After your response, say: "back to you: Orchestrator"

- Radiology, before analysis:
  - What exact image formats, viewing access, and any metadata (contrast phase, slice thickness, window settings, series to prioritize) do you need to run the imaging tool analysis and produce AI-generated findings and a comparison to the radiologist’s report?
  - Confirm you will perform: (a) AI-based image analysis, (b) extraction of AI findings, and (c) side-by-side comparison with the radiologist’s report once images and the report are available.
  - After your response, say: "back to you: Orchestrator"

Please provide the items asked of you (User) so PatientHistory and Radiology can proceed.
