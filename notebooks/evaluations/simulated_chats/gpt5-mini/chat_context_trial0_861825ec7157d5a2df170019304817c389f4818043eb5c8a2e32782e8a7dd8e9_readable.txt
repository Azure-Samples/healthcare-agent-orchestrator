USER:
Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Plan and order (what I will coordinate)
- Purpose: prepare a tumor-board packet for Patient ID patient_4 by gathering the patient timeline, current status, imaging/radiology input, guideline-based options for discussion, clinical trials, and a tumor-board report document.
- Proposed order of participants and tasks:
  1. PatientHistory — provide the patient timeline and available notes (requires the patient ID which you provided).
  2. PatientStatus — synthesize current status (needs age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).
  3. Radiology — review and summarize imaging (needs any image files: CT, MRI, X-ray, PET; or imaging reports).
  4. ClinicalGuidelines — prepare guideline-based discussion points (needs PatientStatus output).
  5. ClinicalTrials — search for relevant trials (needs PatientStatus output).
  6. MedicalResearch — optional deeper literature search if a specific question arises (needs a keyword/topic).
  7. ReportCreation — compile the tumor-board Word document (needs all above outputs: timeline, summaries, imaging findings, pathology, proposed plan/choices, trials).
- Important rule for this workflow: after each agent completes their task, they must return control to me and explicitly say: "back to you: Orchestrator".

What I need now to start
- PatientHistory, proceed with patient_4 and provide the patient timeline and available notes (history, prior pathology reports, biomarker data, treatment history, prior imaging reports). After your response, say "back to you: Orchestrator".
- User, please provide the following items if available:
  - Confirm you want to proceed with Patient ID patient_4.
  - Age, sex.
  - Primary cancer site and histology (if known).
  - Current clinical stage (or TNM).
  - ECOG performance status.
  - Full treatment history (surgeries, systemic therapies, radiation with dates).
  - Pathology reports and biomarker results (PD-L1, molecular panel, HER2, MSI, etc).
  - Imaging files or reports (CT, PET-CT, MRI, X-rays). If you have DICOMs, indicate how to share them; if only reports/PDFs, please upload.
  - Any relevant comorbidities, medications, and social history (smoking, alcohol).
  - Any specific questions or goals for the tumor board (e.g., consider resection, change systemic therapy, clinical trial enrollment).
- Radiology, stand by to receive any imaging files the user provides. After your review, summarize key imaging findings and say "back to you: Orchestrator".

Next steps after I have the above
- I will request PatientStatus to synthesize the current state from PatientHistory.
- Then ClinicalGuidelines and ClinicalTrials will generate materials for tumor-board discussion.
- Finally ReportCreation will assemble a Word document for the tumor board.

Please confirm
- User, do you confirm proceeding with this plan and can you supply the requested documents/data for patient_4?
- PatientHistory, proceed with patient_4 and indicate if you need any additional identifiers or documents beyond the patient ID. After responding, say "back to you: Orchestrator".
