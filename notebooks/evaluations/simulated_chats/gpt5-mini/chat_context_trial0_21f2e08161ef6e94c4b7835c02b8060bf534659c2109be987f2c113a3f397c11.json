What specific record access or clarifying details do you need to assemble the timeline and data above? Please list items you need from the User, then provide the timeline if you have it. End with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n- Radiology, please state what imaging files or reports you need to interpret recent studies for patient_4 (DICOMs, radiology report, date of scan). End with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n- PatientStatus, confirm you will synthesize current status once PatientHistory and Radiology provide their inputs. List any additional data you need (e.g., ECOG). End with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n- MedicalResearch, indicate which keywords or patient phenotype details you need to produce prognosis statistics and likely progression pathways (e.g., cancer type + stage + key biomarker). End with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n- ReportCreation, state the exact inputs you require to draft a short prognosis/progression report suitable for tumor board review. End with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nUser, please provide the requested patient_4 details or give permission to access the record. Once you confirm or provide data, I will instruct PatientHistory to begin.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
