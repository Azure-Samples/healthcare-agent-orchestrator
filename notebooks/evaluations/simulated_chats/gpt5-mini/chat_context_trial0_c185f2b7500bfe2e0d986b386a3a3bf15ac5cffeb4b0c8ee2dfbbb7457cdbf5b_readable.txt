Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Plan and participant order

I will moderate a multi-agent preparation for a tumor-board review of Patient ID: patient_4. The planned order of participants and their roles:
1) PatientHistory — assemble the patient timeline and all relevant history/notes.
2) Radiology — review available imaging or imaging reports (CT, CXR, PET).
3) PatientStatus — synthesize current status (age, stage, primary site, histology, biomarkers, prior treatments, ECOG).
4) ClinicalGuidelines — provide guideline-based options (requires PatientStatus).
5) ClinicalTrials — identify relevant trials (requires PatientStatus).
6) MedicalResearch — supply recent literature if requested (keyword/topic needed).
7) ReportCreation — generate a tumor-board word document using all compiled information.

Important rule: After each agent completes their task they must yield back to me and explicitly say "back to you: Orchestrator".

Next step — gather information

PatientHistory, proceed with patient_4. Provide the full patient timeline and available data including:
- Demographics (age, sex)
- Presenting problem and diagnosis date(s)
- Primary tumor site and histology/pathology report(s)
- Staging (clinical/pathologic)
- Biomarkers/molecular testing (EGFR, ALK, PD-L1, etc. — list results or note if not done)
- Prior treatments (surgery, chemo, radiation, targeted therapy, immunotherapy) with dates and responses/toxicities
- Recent labs (CBC, CMP, relevant tumor markers)
- Performance status (ECOG)
- Comorbidities and social history (smoking, alcohol, living situation)
- Recent imaging reports (CT chest/abdomen/pelvis, PET-CT, brain MRI, X-rays) and dates
- Any pathology images/reports or biopsy notes
- Any clinical questions or decisions requested for the tumor board (e.g., resectability, next-line therapy, clinical trial consideration)
Also tell me what you still need from the user to complete the timeline.

User, can you provide any of the following for patient_4 if available?
- Pathology report(s) or pathology slides
- Imaging files (DICOMs) or imaging reports (CT, PET, MRI, X-ray) and dates
- Recent lab results and ECOG performance status
- Any prior oncology notes or treatment summaries
- Specific tumor-board objectives or questions (e.g., treatment recommendation vs. trial enrollment)
Please upload documents or paste key excerpts. If you cannot upload, provide the key values/text.

Radiology — note: you will need imaging files or imaging reports. If the user can only provide reports, state whether you can proceed on reports alone or require images.

PatientHistory, once you provide the timeline, I will call Radiology and PatientStatus in sequence. Confirm when ready and list any missing items required from the user.

Do you (PatientHistory) need anything else to begin? back to you: Orchestrator.
