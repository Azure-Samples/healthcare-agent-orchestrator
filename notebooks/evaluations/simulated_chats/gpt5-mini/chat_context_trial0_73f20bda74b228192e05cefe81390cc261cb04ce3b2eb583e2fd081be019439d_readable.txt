USER:
Can you scan all pathology and molecular testing to see if these biomarkers are present

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Plan and order of participants
- Goal: scan all pathology and molecular testing to identify whether specified biomarkers are present in the patient’s reports.
- Proposed order of participants:
  1. PatientHistory — retrieve the patient timeline and the pathology / molecular test reports.
  2. PatientStatus — summarize current patient status (useful context for which biomarkers are most relevant).
  3. MedicalResearch — (optional) provide brief notes on the biomarkers found if you want interpretation or references.
  4. ReportCreation — (optional) compile a short summary document of the results for tumor board review.

Important rule to note: after each agent completes their task they should yield the chat back to me (Orchestrator) and explicitly say "back to you: Orchestrator".

Before we proceed I need some input from you and will ask the agents what they need.

User, please provide the following so we can begin:
1. The patient ID you want us to scan (so PatientHistory can locate the correct notes): User, can you provide me with the patient’s ID?
2. Upload the pathology and molecular test reports (PDFs, images, or text). If you cannot upload files, paste the relevant report text here.
3. Which biomarkers do you specifically want us to check? If you don’t have a specific list, do you want us to scan for a standard oncology panel (examples below)? Common biomarkers often checked in solid tumors include:
   - EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, KRAS, MET, HER2, NTRK, RET
   - PD-L1 (IHC), MSI status, Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB)
   - BRCA1/2 (germline/tumor), other HRR genes
   - Any specific somatic or germline panel results you expect
   Please confirm the list or add/remove items.

Questions to the agents (so they can prepare)
- PatientHistory, proceed with: what do you need from the user to retrieve pathology/molecular reports and the patient timeline? (I expect you’ll need patient ID and the uploaded reports or access to the medical record).
  - After your response, say: back to you: Orchestrator

- PatientStatus, proceed with: to prepare a short patient status summary, what specific data elements do you need (I anticipate: age, staging, primary tumor site, histology, biomarkers known, prior treatments, ECOG)? Please list anything else you require.
  - After your response, say: back to you: Orchestrator

Next steps after I have your reply (User)
- Once you provide the patient ID and upload or paste the pathology/molecular reports and confirm which biomarkers to scan, I will:
  1. Ask PatientHistory to extract pathology and molecular test findings.
  2. Have PatientStatus create a brief context summary.
  3. Return the extracted biomarker findings to you for confirmation.
  4. If you request, MedicalResearch can provide brief literature references on any biomarker found, and ReportCreation can compile a document for tumor board.

Please provide the patient ID and upload the reports (or paste the text), and confirm which biomarkers to scan.
