Both produced meaningful objective response rates (ORR) in previously treated KRAS G12C\u2011mutant non\u2011small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and received regulatory approvals in the previously treated metastatic setting (note: confirm current regional indications/dates with an up\u2011to\u2011date search).\\n- There are no definitive head\u2011to\u2011head randomized trials comparing adagrasib vs sotorasib; comparisons are cross\u2011trial and must be interpreted cautiously.\\n\\nKey efficacy metrics (summary ranges from pivotal trials / cohorts)\\n- Sotorasib (CodeBreaK program)\\n  - Phase 2 single\u2011arm data (CodeBreaK 100): ORR in previously treated NSCLC \u2248 mid\u201130%s (commonly cited ~32\u201337%), median duration of response (DoR) around many months (often cited ~10\u201312 months), and median PFS in the single\u2011arm cohorts in the range of ~5\u20137 months. Outcomes varied by prior therapies and cohorts.\\n  - Phase 3 randomized data (CodeBreaK 200) and later analyses reported modest PFS benefit versus docetaxel in pretreated NSCLC (interpret cautiously \u2014 check final publications/labels for exact numbers).\\n- Adagrasib (KRYSTAL program)\\n  - KRYSTAL\u20111 (phase 1/2 multi\u2011cohort): ORR in previously treated NSCLC cohorts often reported in the ~40% range (single\u2011arm estimate), with median DoR often reported on the order of many months (varied by follow\u2011up) and median PFS often in the mid\u2011several\u2011month range. Small subgroup analyses suggested intracranial activity in patients with brain metastases in the trial\u2011selected cohorts.\\n- Intracranial activity\\n  - Adagrasib: trial reports included prospective evaluation of CNS cohorts and documented intracranial responses in some patients (signal of CNS penetration and activity). Reported intracranial response rates were modest but clinically meaningful in small cohorts.\\n  - Sotorasib: CNS data are more limited; case reports and small data subsets suggested some CNS activity but less prospective CNS cohort evidence than adagrasib in the pivotal programs. Direct comparisons are limited by small numbers.\\n- Bottom line on efficacy\\n  - Both agents produce responses and clinical benefit in a substantial minority of pretreated KRAS G12C NSCLC patients. Adagrasib and sotorasib have broadly similar activity in single\u2011arm data, with trial\u2011to\u2011trial variability; intracranial data more directly reported for adagrasib in dedicated cohorts.\\n\\nSafety profiles and differences\\n- Shared/common toxicities (both agents)\\n  - Gastrointestinal: nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, decreased appetite\\n  - Fatigue\\n  - Hepatic laboratory abnormalities (transaminase elevations)\\n  - Peripheral edema, myalgias/arthralgias in some reports\\n  - Low\u2011frequency but important: interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis has been reported with KRAS inhibitors (rare but serious).\\n- Agent\u2011specific or notable signals\\n  - Adagrasib:\\n    - GI toxicities commonly reported; also notable for elevations in serum creatinine in some patients (mechanism discussed below), and for QTc prolongation observed in some trial data (monitoring recommended in trial protocols and labels). Dose interruptions/reductions were common in trials.\\n  - Sotorasib:\\n    - Also associated with transaminitis and diarrhea; hepatotoxicity and other grade \u22653 events reported. Different frequency distributions of specific AEs between trials have been reported, but cross\u2011trial comparisons are imperfect.\\n- Frequency of grade \u22653 AEs, dose reductions, discontinuations\\n  - Both agents had grade \u22653 AE rates in pivotal trials that resulted in dose modifications for a non\u2011trivial minority (dose reductions/interruptions common; permanent discontinuation less frequent). Exact percentages vary by trial/cohort \u2014 verify current labels/trial publications for exact figures.\\n\\nRegulatory status (general)\\n- Sotorasib received accelerated/full approval for KRAS G12C\u2011mutant NSCLC after prior systemic therapy (first approved among KRAS G12C inhibitors).\\n- Adagrasib has also received regulatory approval for KRAS G12C\u2011mutant NSCLC based on KRYSTAL\u20111 (confirm current labeling, indications, and date cutoffs).\\n- Both agents are the basis of ongoing trials and expanded indications are under investigation (combinations, earlier lines, other histologies such as colorectal).\\n\\nMechanisms of resistance and co\u2011mutation impacts\\n- Acquired (on\u2011treatment) resistance mechanisms described in multiple publications and trial reports:\\n  - On\u2011target secondary KRAS alterations: secondary KRAS mutations in positions that interfere with covalent inhibitor binding (e.g., changes at the switch II pocket or other contact residues) \u2014 these can confer resistance to one or both inhibitors depending on the specific mutation.\\n  - KRAS amplification (gene dosage increase).\\n  - Activation of bypass signaling pathways: RTK activation (EGFR, MET amplification), activation of downstream MAPK/PI3K effectors (NRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1/MEK), and other pathway rewiring.\\n  - Histologic transformation (e.g., to small\u2011cell phenotype) reported in some cases.\\n  - Co\u2011occurrence of multiple resistance mechanisms in the same patient (heterogeneous resistance).\\n- Co\u2011mutations and baseline predictors\\n  - STK11 and KEAP1 (and sometimes TP53) are common co\u2011mutations in KRAS\u2011mutant NSCLC and strongly influence outcomes generally (especially responses to immunotherapy). Their effect on KRAS G12C inhibitor efficacy:\\n    - Data are heterogeneous: some subgroup analyses from KRYSTAL\u20111 and CodeBreaK cohorts showed that responses to KRAS G12C inhibitors occur across STK11/KEAP1 subgroups. However, certain co\u2011mutations (especially KEAP1 and concurrent TP53/STK11 patterns) may be associated with poorer overall outcomes and possibly shorter durability of benefit in some series.\\n    - KEAP1 mutations in particular are associated with worse prognosis overall and may be linked to reduced durability of responses to multiple systemic therapies; evidence that KEAP1 uniformly abrogates benefit from KRAS G12C inhibitors is limited \u2014 results are mixed and sample sizes small.\\n    - STK11: some analyses suggested preserved ORR but potentially shorter PFS in STK11\u2011mutant subgroups in some cohorts \u2014 conclusions are not definitive.\\n  - Practical takeaway: co\u2011mutations (STK11/KEAP1/TP53) are prognostic and may modulate relative benefit/duration but do not universally preclude responses to KRAS G12C inhibitors. Precise effect sizes vary by dataset and need updated subgroup analyses.\\n- Cross\u2011resistance between agents\\n  - Prior exposure to one KRAS G12C inhibitor may limit subsequent response to another due to overlapping mechanisms of on\u2011target resistance (secondary KRAS mutations) or shared bypass alterations; however, some case reports/series describe mixed responses and investigational strategies (switching agents, combination approaches) are being studied. There is no reliable evidence that switching between sotorasib and adagrasib after progression will consistently recapture durable responses \u2014 individualized molecular re\u2011profiling at progression is often emphasized in the literature.\\n\\nOther important clinical/research notes\\n- Combination strategies under active study:\\n  - KRAS G12C inhibitors combined with SHP2 inhibitors, SOS1 inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors (in CRC), MEK inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors \u2014 rationales include preventing or delaying adaptive resistance and enhancing depth/duration of response.\\n- Biomarker/re\u2011biopsy guidance in literature:\\n  - Many groups recommend molecular profiling at progression (tissue or cfDNA) to identify targetable resistance mechanisms (MET amplification, secondary KRAS mutations, others) that may guide trial enrollment or combinatory strategies.\\n- Real\u2011world evidence:\\n  - Early real\u2011world series largely mirror trial efficacy/safety signals but can show different discontinuation patterns and broader patient characteristics; larger and later\u2011cutoff RWE datasets may be available after my internal cutoff and should be checked.\\n- Evidence limitations\\n  - Much data are from single\u2011arm or early\u2011phase cohorts, limited sample sizes, and short median follow\u2011up for some endpoints. Cross\u2011trial comparisons (adagrasib vs sotorasib) are inherently confounded by differences in patient selection, prior therapy, CNS inclusion criteria, and follow\u2011up.\\n\\nPractical interpretive points (non\u2011recommendatory)\\n- Both sotorasib and adagrasib have demonstrated clinically meaningful activity in previously treated KRAS G12C NSCLC; adagrasib has reported prospective intracranial cohort data supporting CNS activity, whereas sotorasib CNS evidence is more limited in prospective datasets (but some activity reported).\\n- Co\u2011mutations (STK11/KEAP1/TP53) are common and influence prognosis; evidence on differential response to KRAS inhibitors across these subgroups is mixed and evolving.\\n- Acquired resistance is complex and often heterogeneous\u2014on\u2011target secondary KRAS mutations and bypass pathway activation are frequent themes; molecular re\u2011profiling at progression is commonly reported in the literature to inform next steps or trial selection.\\n\\nWhat remains to do / recommendation for next evidence step\\n- I can (A) retry the live GraphRAG/data retrieval to fetch the exact trial numbers, final ORR/mPFS/mOS/DoR values, intracranial ORRs, exact grade \u22653 AE rates, and regulatory documents up to June 30, 2025 (this requires re\u2011running the retrieval tool), or (B) you can supply specific recent publications/abstracts you want summarized.\\n- If you want immediate, detailed numeric tables and precise citations (NCT IDs, publication DOIs, conference abstracts with dates, FDA label excerpts), I should retry live retrieval so we include the latest June 30, 2025 cutoff data.\\n\\nNext actions I need from you (User) \u2014 required before proceeding\\n1) Do you want me to retry the live data retrieval to produce an up\u2011to\u2011date, citation\u2011backed numeric summary through June 30, 2025?

There are no robust head\u2011to\u2011head randomized trials directly comparing the two agents \u2014 differences below are based on single\u2011arm trial cohorts (CodeBreaK, KRYSTAL) and cross\u2011trial comparisons (interpret cautiously).\\n\\nKey trials / data sources commonly cited\\n- Sotorasib: CodeBreaK 100 (phase 1/2 expansion cohorts), CodeBreaK 200 (randomized phase 3 vs docetaxel in previously treated NSCLC; published/readouts available in public domain).\\n- Adagrasib: KRYSTAL\u20111 (phase 1/2 multi\u2011cohort program), including dedicated CNS cohorts and tumor\u2011type cohorts (NSCLC, CRC).\\n- Multiple translational/biopsy and cfDNA studies describing acquired resistance mechanisms and co\u2011mutation impacts (STK11, KEAP1, TP53) across these programs.\\n\\nApproximate efficacy metrics (typical values reported in pivotal cohorts \u2014 numeric values are approximate and should be validated against the latest primary publications/labels)\\n- Sotorasib (CodeBreaK 100, previously treated NSCLC cohort; single\u2011arm)\\n  - ORR: ~32\u201337% (many reports cite ~37%)\\n  - Median duration of response (mDoR): roughly ~10 months (range ~6\u201312+ mo depending on cohort/follow\u2011up)\\n  - Median progression\u2011free survival (mPFS): roughly ~5\u20137 months\\n  - Median overall survival (mOS): variable (~11\u201313 months reported in some cohorts)\\n- Sotorasib (CodeBreaK 200 randomized vs docetaxel)\\n  - Reported improvements in PFS vs docetaxel in some analyses (numerical HRs published/announced in meeting materials). Check the final peer\u2011reviewed publication/label for precise numbers.\\n- Adagrasib (KRYSTAL\u20111, previously treated NSCLC cohorts)\\n  - ORR: commonly reported in the ~40% range (examples often quoted ~42\u201345% in published cohorts)\\n  - mDoR: often reported in months (e.g., medians in the comparable single\u2011digit to low\u2011double\u2011digit months range; follow\u2011up length matters)\\n  - mPFS: generally mid\u2011several months (comparable to sotorasib in single\u2011arm data), sometimes reported slightly longer in some cohorts \u2014 cross\u2011trial comparisons not definitive\\n- Intracranial activity\\n  - Adagrasib: prospective CNS cohorts in KRYSTAL\u20111 reported intracranial responses in a proportion of patients with measurable brain metastases (signals of CNS penetration and intracranial activity). Reported intracranial ORRs in dedicated small cohorts were clinically meaningful though sample sizes small.\\n  - Sotorasib: less extensive prospective CNS cohort data in initial pivotal publications; some case reports / small subgroup data suggest occasional CNS responses. Overall, adagrasib has more explicitly reported CNS cohort data in the pivotal program.\\n- Bottom line on numbers\\n  - Both agents: ORR in previously treated NSCLC typically ~30\u201345% (single\u2011arm cohorts); mPFS commonly mid\u2011single\u2011digit months; mDoR often several months (sometimes ~10 months). Exact values and confidence intervals depend on cohort size, prior therapy mix, and follow\u2011up.\\n\\nSafety and tolerability (summary with approximate frequencies)\\n- Common any\u2011grade AEs for both agents: GI (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting), fatigue, increased liver transaminases, decreased appetite, musculoskeletal symptoms.\\n- Important toxicities to monitor:\\n  - Hepatotoxicity (ALT/AST elevations) \u2014 reported for both agents; some patients require dose interruption/reduction.\\n  - QTc prolongation \u2014 reported with adagrasib in trials (monitoring recommended); QT signals have been an observed safety item to check in labels/protocols.\\n  - Interstitial lung disease / pneumonitis \u2014 rare but reported with KRAS inhibitors (serious; monitor respiratory symptoms).\\n- Grade \u22653 adverse event rates and discontinuation\\n  - Grade \u22653 treatment\u2011related AEs occurred in a non\u2011trivial minority across trials (single\u2011digit to low\u201120s percent ranges depending on agent/cohort). Dose reductions and interruptions were commonly used; permanent discontinuation for toxicity less common but occurred (percentages vary by trial).\\n- Agent\u2011specific notes\\n  - Adagrasib: noted for frequent GI AEs and has reported transient creatinine increases and QTc monitoring requirements in trial protocols/labels. Dose modifications were common in KRYSTAL\u20111.\\n  - Sotorasib: reported transaminitis among important toxicities; frequency distributions differ across cohorts but overall tolerability profile broadly similar to adagrasib with some differences in the incidence of particular lab abnormalities or GI toxicities.\\n\\nRegulatory status (as of broadly reported milestones through 2023\u20132024; please verify through June 30, 2025)\\n- Sotorasib (Lumakras/AMG\u2011510): FDA approval for KRAS G12C\u2013mutant locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in patients who have received at least one prior systemic therapy (first KRAS G12C inhibitor approved, 2021). Check local/regional labels for exact indications/labeling language.\\n- Adagrasib (KRAZATI/MRTX849): regulatory approvals were granted in major jurisdictions for KRAS G12C\u2013mutant NSCLC after prior systemic therapy based on KRYSTAL\u20111 data (approval announcements occurred in 2023 in the US; check exact approval type/scope/label text and dates).\\n- Indications in other tumor types (e.g., CRC) and combinations (e.g., adagrasib + cetuximab) have shown activity; regulatory actions for combinations/other histologies depend on subsequent trials and regional regulators \u2014 verify current labels.\\n\\nResistance mechanisms \u2014 overview and clinical implications\\n- Acquired (on\u2011treatment) resistance is common and heterogeneous. Main classes:\\n  1. On\u2011target secondary KRAS alterations that impair inhibitor binding\\n     - Secondary KRAS mutations (e.g., at residues in/near the switch\u2011II pocket, such as Y96 alterations and others) have been reported that directly reduce binding of covalent G12C inhibitors. Some secondary mutations confer resistance to both agents; others may show differential sensitivity depending on the binding mode.\\n  2. KRAS amplification\\n     - Increased KRAS gene copy number limiting inhibitor effect.\\n  3. Bypass pathway activation / RTK upregulation\\n     - MET amplification, EGFR activation, HER family signaling, activation of upstream RTKs leading to re\u2011activation of downstream MAPK/PI3K signaling.\\n  4. Downstream pathway alterations\\n     - Mutations or amplifications in NRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1 (MEK1), or PI3K pathway components resulting in continued pathway signaling.\\n  5. Histologic transformation\\n     - Transformation to small\u2011cell or other lineage changes has been reported in some cases.\\n  6. Polyclonal / heterogeneous mechanisms\\n     - Multiple mechanisms may coexist in one patient or across metastases; cfDNA often shows polyclonal resistance patterns.\\n- Clinical implications\\n  - Re\u2011biopsy or cfDNA profiling at progression is commonly recommended in the literature to (a) identify potentially targetable bypass mechanisms (e.g., MET amplification) and (b) determine whether on\u2011target secondary mutations are present that might preclude benefit from switching agents or suggest enrollment in combination trials.\\n  - There is no guaranteed strategy to overcome all resistance mechanisms; combination approaches (SHP2, SOS1, MEK, RTK inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors in CRC, immune strategies) are under active investigation.\\n\\nImpact of baseline co\u2011mutations (STK11, KEAP1, TP53 and others)\\n- General point: STK11 and KEAP1 are frequent co\u2011mutations in KRAS\u2011mutant NSCLC and are important prognostic modifiers (particularly for responses to immunotherapy and overall prognosis). How they affect KRAS G12C inhibitor efficacy has been evaluated in subgroup analyses:\\n  - STK11\\n    - Often associated with immunotherapy resistance but responses to KRAS G12C inhibitors have been observed in STK11\u2011mutant tumors. Some datasets suggest STK11 co\u2011mutation does not abolish ORR to KRAS G12C inhibitors, though durability (PFS/DoR) may differ in some analyses.\\n  - KEAP1\\n    - KEAP1 co\u2011mutation is associated with poor prognosis overall. Some series suggest that KEAP1\u2011mutant tumors may have shorter durations of benefit with various systemic therapies; the effect on KRAS G12C inhibitor ORR is mixed and not uniformly negative in early reports, but KEAP1 often portends a worse outcome and possibly shorter durability.\\n  - TP53\\n    - TP53 co\u2011mutations are common and may interact variably; some reports suggest TP53 co\u2011mutant tumors remain responsive to KRAS G12C inhibitors.\\n- Net practical interpretation\\n  - Co\u2011mutations are prognostic and may modulate durability of benefit but do not universally prevent responses to KRAS G12C inhibitors. Subgroup sample sizes are limited and results heterogeneous; molecular profiling remains important to inform prognosis and trial selection.\\n\\nCross\u2011resistance and sequential use of KRAS G12C inhibitors\\n- Prior exposure to a KRAS G12C inhibitor can lead to on\u2011target secondary mutations or bypass mechanisms that reduce the chance of response to a subsequent KRAS G12C inhibitor; case reports and small series show mixed results for \u201cswitching\u201d agents after progression.\\n- Molecular re\u2011profiling is strongly advised before attempting a second KRAS G12C agent; enrollment in clinical trials of combination strategies or next\u2011generation inhibitors is often the preferred strategy in the literature when resistance mechanisms are identified.\\n\\nCombinations under study (high\u2011level)\\n- Rational combinations aim to delay or overcome adaptive resistance: SHP2 inhibitors, SOS1 inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors (notably in CRC), MET inhibitors for MET\u2011amplified escape, and immunotherapy combinations. Many trials are ongoing; clinical applicability depends on mechanism identified at progression.\\n\\nPractical clinical takeaways (non\u2011recommendatory)\\n- If the patient is KRAS p.G12C\u2013mutant and previously treated, a KRAS G12C inhibitor (sotorasib or adagrasib) is an evidence\u2011based option supported by single\u2011agent activity and regulatory approvals in many jurisdictions \u2014 choice between agents may depend on prior exposures, CNS disease, comorbidities, and access/labeling.\\n- If CNS metastases are present and clinically relevant, the adagrasib program has more explicitly reported prospective intracranial data (favors consideration, but individual patient factors matter).\\n- Re\u2011profiling (tissue or cfDNA) at baseline and at progression is important to identify co\u2011mutations and acquired resistance mechanisms that can guide sequencing or trial selection.\\n- Evaluate organ function (hepatic, cardiac/QTc considerations with adagrasib), concomitant medications (CYP interactions, QTc drugs), and the patient\u2019s performance status when assessing eligibility/tolerability.\\n\\nLimitations of this summary and recommended next steps\\n- This summary is based on conventional literature knowledge (KRYSTAL and CodeBreaK programs and translational reports) but is not a live GraphRAG output. Numeric values above are approximate ranges reported in single\u2011arm cohorts and early randomized data; exact ORR, mPFS, mDoR, grade \u22653 AE rates, intracranial ORR, and regulatory label language should be confirmed by running updated searches of:\\n  - Full peer\u2011reviewed trial publications (KRYSTAL\u20111, CodeBreaK 100/200, and any phase 3 reports),\\n  - Recent major meeting abstracts (ASCO, ESMO, WCLC, AACR),\\n  - FDA/EMA approval letters and current package inserts,\\n  - Recent real\u2011world evidence reports and translational papers describing acquired resistance.\\n- If you want precise, citable numeric tables (ORR with 95% CI, mPFS, mDoR, grade \u22653 AE frequencies, intracranial ORR, N sizes), I will re\u2011attempt a live data retrieval (GraphRAG) and return the exact tool output and sources up through the June 30, 2025 cutoff you chose.\\n\\nNext choices for you\\n1) Do you want me to retry the live GraphRAG retrieval now to produce a citation\u2011backed numeric summary through June 30, 2025?

Dose interruptions/reductions are common; permanent discontinuation for toxicity less frequent.\\n  - Agent\u2011specific notes:\\n    - Adagrasib: notable for GI AEs, QTc observation in trial data, and frequent dose modifications in KRYSTAL\u20111 cohorts.\\n    - Sotorasib: notable for transaminitis events; overall tolerability broadly similar but frequency of particular AEs differs across trials.\\n\\n- Regulatory status (high\u2011level as reported in public domain up to recent years; confirm labels as of June 30, 2025)\\n  - Sotorasib (Lumakras/AMG\u2011510): received FDA approval for KRAS G12C\u2013mutant locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC after prior systemic therapy (first-in-class approval in 2021).\\n  - Adagrasib (KRAZATI/MRTX849): received regulatory approval(s) in major jurisdictions for previously treated KRAS G12C\u2013mutant NSCLC based on KRYSTAL\u20111 data (verify exact indications/label wording and dates by checking current labels/regulatory documents).\\n\\n- Main resistance mechanisms (summary)\\n  - On\u2011target alterations: secondary KRAS mutations (mutations at switch\u2011II pocket / other residues that interfere with covalent binding) that reduce inhibitor binding \u2014 can confer resistance to one or both G12C inhibitors depending on mutation.\\n  - KRAS amplification.\\n  - Bypass pathway activation / RTK upregulation: MET amplification, EGFR activation, HER family activation, and other RTK\u2011driven escape mechanisms.\\n  - Downstream pathway alterations: NRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1/MEK, PI3K pathway changes.\\n  - Histologic transformation (e.g., small\u2011cell transformation) in a subset of cases.\\n  - Polyclonal/heterogeneous resistance: multiple concurrent mechanisms detectable by cfDNA or multi\u2011site biopsies are common.\\n  - Clinical implication: molecular re\u2011profiling (tissue and/or cfDNA) at progression is strongly recommended to identify specific resistance mechanisms that may guide trial selection or targeted combination strategies (e.g., MET inhibitors for MET amplification).\\n\\n- Impact of common co\u2011mutations (STK11, KEAP1, TP53)\\n  - STK11:\\n    - Frequently co\u2011mutated with KRAS; associated with poor response to immunotherapy in KRAS\u2011mutant NSCLC.\\n    - Responses to KRAS G12C inhibitors have been observed in STK11\u2011mutant tumors; some data suggest ORR preserved but durability (PFS/DoR) may be shorter in some series \u2014 results heterogeneous.\\n  - KEAP1:\\n    - Associated with poor prognosis overall; some datasets suggest shorter durations of benefit across therapies.\\n    - Effect on ORR to KRAS G12C inhibitors is mixed; KEAP1 often correlates with worse outcomes but does not uniformly eliminate response.\\n  - TP53:\\n    - Common co\u2011mutation; variable effects reported \u2014 many TP53\u2011co\u2011mutant tumors remain responsive to KRAS G12C inhibitors.\\n  - Net interpretation: STK11/KEAP1/TP53 are important prognostic modifiers. They may modulate durability or outcomes but do not categorically preclude response to KRAS G12C inhibitors. Subgroup sample sizes are limited and findings are not fully definitive.\\n\\n- Practical clinical implications (non\u2011recommendatory)\\n  - KRAS G12C inhibitors are an evidence\u2011based option for previously treated KRAS G12C NSCLC; choice between agents may consider prior therapies, CNS involvement, organ function (QTc and hepatic), and access.\\n  - If CNS disease is clinically relevant, adagrasib\u2019s CNS cohort data may weigh into decision\u2011making (but individual factors matter).\\n  - Re\u2011profiling at progression (tissue + cfDNA) is important to define resistance mechanisms and guide next steps, especially for potential combination approaches or trial enrollment.\\n  - Sequential use of one KRAS G12C inhibitor after progression on another is unpredictable; on\u2011target secondary mutations often limit cross\u2011sensitivity \u2014 molecular retesting is advised before sequencing agents.\\n\\n- Limitations and recommended confirmatory actions\\n  - This summary provides approximate numeric ranges and qualitative conclusions from the CodeBreaK and KRYSTAL programs and translational reports but is not a substitute for up\u2011to\u2011date, source\u2011level verification.\\n  - If you need precise, citable numeric tables (ORR with 95% CI, exact mPFS, mDoR, intracranial ORR, exact grade \u22653 AE rates, N sizes, and current label text), I recommend retrieval of the primary publications/meeting abstracts and current regulatory labels (I can attempt another live retrieval if you want).\\n\\nPatient\u2011team quick items needed to proceed\\n1) Radiology/ReportCreation: include after guideline summary?

Net: adagrasib has more explicit reported CNS cohort evidence.\\n\\n- Safety differences (high\u2011level)\\n  - Shared common AEs: nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, transaminase (ALT/AST) elevations, decreased appetite, musculoskeletal symptoms.\\n  - Adagrasib: notable for frequent GI AEs, QTc\u2011prolongation signal reported in trials (monitoring advised), and transient creatinine increases described; dose interruptions/reductions common in trials.\\n  - Sotorasib: notable for transaminitis/hepatic events; overall tolerability broadly similar to adagrasib but incidence of specific AEs differs across trials.\\n  - Grade \u22653 treatment\u2011related AEs occurred in a non\u2011trivial minority (commonly low\u2011teens to low\u201120s % in reports); dose modifications are common; permanent discontinuation less frequent.\\n\\n- Regulatory status (high\u2011level; verify current labels)\\n  - Sotorasib (Lumakras): FDA approval in previously treated KRAS G12C\u2013mutant locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC (first approval ~2021); regional labels vary.\\n  - Adagrasib (KRAZATI): approvals in major jurisdictions for previously treated KRAS G12C NSCLC based on KRYSTAL\u20111 data (verify local label text/dates).\\n\\n- Main resistance mechanisms (categories and clinical implications)\\n  - On\u2011target secondary KRAS alterations that impair covalent inhibitor binding (secondary KRAS mutations at switch\u2011II pocket/nearby residues) \u2014 can confer resistance to one or both agents.\\n  - KRAS amplification.\\n  - Bypass pathway activation / RTK upregulation (e.g., MET amplification, EGFR/HER family activation).\\n  - Downstream pathway alterations (NRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1/MEK, PI3K changes).\\n  - Histologic transformation (e.g., small\u2011cell transformation) in some cases.\\n  - Polyclonal/heterogeneous resistance is common (multiple mechanisms concurrently detected by cfDNA).\\n  - Clinical implication: re\u2011biopsy and/or comprehensive cfDNA profiling at progression is strongly recommended to identify actionable mechanisms (e.g., MET amp) and to guide enrollment in combination or mechanism\u2011directed trials.\\n\\n- Impact of common co\u2011mutations (STK11, KEAP1, TP53)\\n  - STK11: common with KRAS; associated with poor immunotherapy outcomes. Responses to KRAS G12C inhibitors still occur \u2014 ORR may be preserved in many series but some reports suggest shorter PFS/DoR (data heterogeneous).\\n  - KEAP1: linked to poorer prognosis; effect on ORR is mixed but KEAP1 frequently associates with shorter durability of benefit.\\n  - TP53: common; many TP53\u2011co\u2011mutant tumors respond to KRAS G12C inhibitors; net effects variable.\\n  - Overall: these co\u2011mutations are important prognostic modifiers and may influence durability more than initial response rate; subgroup sample sizes are limited and findings are not uniformly definitive.\\n\\n- Sequential use and cross\u2011resistance\\n  - Progression on one KRAS G12C inhibitor often yields on\u2011target alterations or bypass changes that can limit benefit from another single\u2011agent KRAS G12C inhibitor; sequential single\u2011agent switching is unpredictable. Molecular re\u2011profiling prior to sequencing agents is recommended; clinical trials of combinations or next\u2011generation inhibitors are a common strategy at progression.\\n\\n- Practical, non\u2011recommendatory takeaways\\n  - For a previously treated patient with KRAS p.G12C NSCLC, either sotorasib or adagrasib represents an evidence\u2011based option; choice may depend on prior therapy, CNS involvement, organ function (QTc/hepatic), and access/labeling.\\n  - If CNS metastases are clinically meaningful, adagrasib\u2019s CNS cohort data may be relevant.\\n  - Re\u2011profiling at progression (tissue and/or cfDNA) is critical to guide next steps and trial selection.\\n\\nLimitations\\n- Numeric ranges above are approximate and derived from single\u2011arm cohorts and early randomized reports; exact ORR/mPFS/mDoR with 95% CIs, precise intracranial ORR numerators/denominators, exact grade \u22653 AE rates, and current label text should be verified from primary trial publications, meeting abstracts, and regulatory labels (I can retry live retrieval for precise, citable data when GraphRAG is available).\\n\\nback to you: Orchestrator\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"ai_model_id\": \"gpt-5-mini\",\n      \"metadata\": {\n        \"logprobs\": null,\n        \"id\": \"chatcmpl-C9tge7Hl5VlhbTbR4thP1SAx1Z0F4\",\n        \"created\": 1756475048,\n        \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n        \"usage\": {\n          \"prompt_tokens\": 33407,\n          \"completion_tokens\": 1108\n        }\n      },\n      \"content_type\": \"message\",\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"name\": \"Orchestrator\",\n      \"items\": [\n        {\n          \"metadata\": {},\n          \"content_type\": \"text\",\n          \"text\": \"Summary so far\\n- MedicalResearch has provided a concise evidence\u2011focused synthesis comparing adagrasib vs sotorasib, including efficacy ranges, intracranial activity signals, safety differences, regulatory high\u2011level status, main resistance mechanisms, and the effects of common co\u2011mutations (STK11, KEAP1, TP53).  \\n- Next step: build the patient timeline and current\u2011status summary so ClinicalTrials and ClinicalGuidelines can be applied in the patient\u2019s specific context.\\n\\nTwo quick items I need from you now\\n1) Radiology/ReportCreation: do you want Radiology review and a tumor\u2011board style report created after the guideline summary?

For exact, citable point estimates and current label wording I can retry a live retrieval when GraphRAG is available.\\n\\nConcise, evidence\u2011focused summary\\n\\n- Key trials / cohorts\\n  - Sotorasib: CodeBreaK\u2011100 (phase 1/2 expansion cohorts in previously treated KRAS G12C NSCLC) and CodeBreaK\u2011200 (randomized phase 3 vs docetaxel in previously treated NSCLC).\\n  - Adagrasib: KRYSTAL\u20111 (phase 1/2 multi\u2011cohort program) including dedicated CNS cohorts; additional tumor\u2011type cohorts (e.g., CRC) and combination cohorts reported.\\n\\n- Key efficacy metrics (approximate ranges from pivotal cohorts; cross\u2011trial comparisons are imperfect)\\n  - Sotorasib (previously treated NSCLC): ORR \u2248 30\u201340%; median PFS \u2248 5\u20137 months; median DoR typically several months (many reports ~6\u201312 months).\\n  - Adagrasib (previously treated NSCLC): ORR \u2248 35\u201345%; median PFS mid\u2011several months (generally comparable to sotorasib in single\u2011arm data); median DoR variable with durable responses in a subset.\\n  - No definitive head\u2011to\u2011head randomized comparison \u2014 apparent differences reflect single\u2011arm cohort variability and differing eligibility/CNS criteria.\\n\\n- CNS / intracranial activity\\n  - Adagrasib: prospective CNS cohorts in KRYSTAL\u20111 demonstrated intracranial responses in a meaningful minority of patients with measurable brain metastases (evidence of CNS penetration).\\n  - Sotorasib: prospective CNS data in pivotal CodeBreaK publications are more limited; scattered case reports and small subgroup data indicate occasional CNS activity. Net: adagrasib has more explicit prospective CNS cohort evidence.\\n\\n- Major safety differences (high level)\\n  - Shared common AEs: GI (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting), fatigue, transaminase (ALT/AST) elevations, decreased appetite, musculoskeletal complaints.\\n  - Adagrasib: notable trial signals for GI toxicity, transient creatinine increases, and QTc prolongation observed in some patients (trial protocols/labels recommend monitoring); dose interruptions/reductions common.\\n  - Sotorasib: notable for hepatotoxicity/transaminitis in pivotal cohorts; overall tolerability broadly similar, but incidence patterns of specific AEs differ across studies.\\n  - Grade \u22653 treatment\u2011related AEs occurred in a meaningful minority (commonly low\u2011teens to low\u201120s percent in reported cohorts); dose modifications frequent; permanent discontinuations less common.\\n\\n- Main resistance mechanisms (categories)\\n  1. On\u2011target secondary KRAS alterations (secondary KRAS mutations in/near the switch\u2011II pocket or other residues that impair covalent inhibitor binding) \u2014 can confer resistance to one or both agents depending on the mutation.\\n  2. KRAS amplification.\\n  3. Bypass/RTK activation (MET amplification, EGFR/HER family activation, other RTKs).\\n  4. Downstream pathway alterations (NRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1/MEK, PI3K pathway changes).\\n  5. Histologic transformation (e.g., small\u2011cell transformation) in some cases.\\n  6. Polyclonal/heterogeneous resistance (multiple concurrent mechanisms detectable by cfDNA/tumor sequencing).\\n  - Clinical implication: molecular re\u2011profiling at progression (tissue and/or comprehensive cfDNA) is strongly recommended to identify actionable mechanisms (e.g., MET amp) and guide trial or combination therapy selection.\\n\\n- Impact of common co\u2011mutations (STK11, KEAP1, TP53)\\n  - STK11: frequently co\u2011mutated with KRAS and associated with poor immunotherapy outcomes. Data show responses to KRAS G12C inhibitors still occur in STK11\u2011mutant tumors; some series report preserved ORR but shorter PFS/DoR (heterogeneous results).\\n  - KEAP1: associated with worse overall prognosis; evidence on effect on ORR to KRAS G12C inhibitors is mixed, but KEAP1 often correlates with shorter durability of benefit.\\n  - TP53: common co\u2011mutation with variable effects; many TP53\u2011co\u2011mutant tumors retain responsiveness.\\n  - Net interpretation: STK11/KEAP1/TP53 are prognostic modifiers that may reduce durability more than initial response rate; subgroup sample sizes are limited and findings are not uniformly definitive.\\n\\n- Sequential use / cross\u2011resistance\\n  - Progression on one KRAS G12C inhibitor frequently yields on\u2011target secondary mutations or bypass changes that may limit benefit from another single\u2011agent KRAS G12C inhibitor; sequential single\u2011agent switching is unpredictable. Molecular retesting before attempting a different KRAS G12C agent is recommended; clinical trials of combinations or next\u2011generation inhibitors are common strategies at progression.\\n\\nPractical, non\u2011recommendatory takeaways\\n- For a previously treated KRAS p.G12C NSCLC patient, sotorasib and adagrasib are evidence\u2011based single\u2011agent options; choice considerations include prior therapies, CNS disease (adagrasib has more explicit intracranial cohort data), organ function (hepatic and QTc), concomitant medications, access, and label specifics.\\n- Re\u2011profiling at progression (tissue and/or cfDNA) is important to define resistance mechanisms and guide next steps or trial enrollment.\\n\\nLimitations and next step\\n- Numeric ranges above are approximate \u2014 for precise ORR with CIs, exact mPFS/mDoR point estimates, intracranial ORR numerators/denominators, exact grade \u22653 AE rates, and current regulatory label wording I can reattempt a live GraphRAG retrieval (cutoff to June 30, 2025) and return exact source outputs and citations if you want.\\n\\nPatient\u2011team quick items needed to proceed\\n1) Radiology/ReportCreation after guideline summary?
