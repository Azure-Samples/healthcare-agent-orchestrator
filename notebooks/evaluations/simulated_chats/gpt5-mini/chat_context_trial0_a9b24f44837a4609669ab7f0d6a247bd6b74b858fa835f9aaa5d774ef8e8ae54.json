PatientHistory \u2014 gather patient timeline and raw data (history, pathology reports, biomarker results, prior imaging reports, treatment history, social/family history, labs, ECOG).\\n2. PatientStatus \u2014 synthesize current status (age, primary site, histology, staging at diagnosis, biomarkers, ECOG, treatment history summary).\\n3. Radiology \u2014 review actual imaging (if available) and provide latest imaging findings and impressions.\\n4. ReportCreation \u2014 assemble the formatted Word tumor-board report using the gathered information (timeline, clinical summary, path, imaging, treatments, suggested attachments).\\n(If needed later: ClinicalTrials or MedicalResearch can be asked to add trial options or literature; we will request them only if you want those sections.)\\n\\nImportant rule to follow here:\\nEach agent, after completing their task, should yield the chat back to me (Orchestrator) by ending their reply with exactly:\\nback to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nNext steps \u2014 requests to agents and to you\\n\\n1) PatientHistory, proceed with patient_4:\\n- What specific items do you need from me (Orchestrator) or the User to produce a complete patient timeline and to list biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, pathology excerpts, social history and ECOG? Examples of useful items: pathology report (including receptor/bio results), molecular panel, prior clinic notes, chemotherapy/radiation/surgery dates and regimens, prior imaging reports (CT/PET/MRI/X-ray), lab trends, and performance status documentation.\\n- If you already have access to patient_4's record, please state which documents/data you will extract and the items you still require.\\nPlease end with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\n2) PatientStatus, please standby:\\n- What exact inputs do you require from PatientHistory to generate the current status summary? (I expect: age, primary site, histology, biomarkers, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, ECOG performance status.)\\nPlease end with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\n3) Radiology, please standby:\\n- What imaging files or reports do you need to provide an up-to-date imaging interpretation? (DICOM CT chest/abdomen/pelvis, PET-CT, MRI, X-rays, and/or latest radiology report). If the user can upload images, please specify preferred formats and any required identifiers.\\nPlease end with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\n4) ReportCreation, please standby:\\n- What specific content fields and formatting preferences do you need to create the Word document for tumor-board presentation? (Examples: title page patient identifiers, one-page summary, timeline, pathology slide images, imaging snapshots, appendices with full reports, recommended font/heading sizes, inclusion of signature block.)\\nPlease end with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nRequests for the User (explicit)\\nUser, can you provide the following for patient_4 (please attach or indicate if the data is already accessible to our system):\\n- Pathology report (including histology, grade, biomarker panel/molecular results)\\n- Staging information or initial staging report\\n- Treatment history (dates and regimens for surgery, chemo, radiation, immunotherapy, targeted therapy)\\n- Latest imaging (CT/PET/MRI/X-ray) \u2014 DICOM or PDF radiology reports and images if available\\n- ECOG performance status and current clinical status notes\\n- Any specific tumor-board formatting preferences (institutional header, logos, required signatories)\\nIf you cannot provide files, please confirm that PatientHistory should proceed with existing EHR-accessible records for patient_4.\\n\\nPlease confirm you approve this plan and provide the requested files or permission to access patient_4 records.
