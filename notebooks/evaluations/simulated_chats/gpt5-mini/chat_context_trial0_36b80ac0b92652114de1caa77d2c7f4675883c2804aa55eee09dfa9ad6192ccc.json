PatientHistory \u2014 gather the patient timeline, clinical notes, pathology reports, prior treatments, and any available documents. (Needs patient ID and any records the User can provide.)\\n  2. Radiology \u2014 review and summarize imaging (CT, PET, MRI, X\u2011ray). (Needs image files or links.)\\n  3. PatientStatus \u2014 synthesize current status (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG). (Needs the items above from PatientHistory.)\\n  4. ClinicalGuidelines \u2014 produce guideline-based treatment options for tumor-board discussion (will use PatientStatus).\\n  5. ClinicalTrials \u2014 list potentially relevant trials (will use PatientStatus).\\n  6. MedicalResearch \u2014 provide literature/research summaries if requested (needs keywords/topics).\\n  7. ReportCreation \u2014 assemble a tumor-board word document using all collected inputs.\\n\\nImportant rule to follow: Each agent, after completing their task, should yield the chat back to me (Orchestrator) by ending their reply with:\\nback to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nBefore I ask the agents to proceed, I need confirmation from you and some patient documents.\\n\\nUser, please confirm you want me to proceed with the plan above for Patient ID: patient_4. Also, can you provide the following information and documents (attach files or paste text where available)?\\n- Patient\u2019s age\\n- Primary cancer site and histology/pathology report(s)\\n- Clinical stage (if known)\\n- Biomarker results (e.g., EGFR, ALK, PD-L1, HER2, MSI, BRCA, etc. \u2014 whichever are relevant)\\n- Prior treatments (surgery, chemo, radiation, immunotherapy; dates)\\n- Current medications and comorbidities\\n- ECOG performance status\\n- Latest labs (CBC, CMP, relevant tumor markers)\\n- Imaging files (CT, PET-CT, MRI, chest x-ray) or links to DICOMs\\n- Any notes from treating oncologist or recent progress notes\\n- Social history (smoking, alcohol, living situation) if relevant\\n- Any specific questions or goals for the tumor board (e.g., is this for curative intent, second opinion, trial eligibility, surgical candidacy)\\n\\nIf any of these items are unavailable, say which are missing.\\n\\nPatientHistory, proceed with patient_4. What specific data do you need from the User to compile the patient timeline and notes? Please state exactly which files or data you require, and when you have the timeline ready, provide it and then end with:\\nback to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nAwaiting the User confirmation and the files, and PatientHistory\u2019s list of needed items.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
