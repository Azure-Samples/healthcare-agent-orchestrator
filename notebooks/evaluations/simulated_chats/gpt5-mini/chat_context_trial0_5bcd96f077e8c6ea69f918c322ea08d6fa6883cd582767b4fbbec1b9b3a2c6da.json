Proposed order of contributors and rationale:\\n1. PatientHistory \u2014 to provide the patient timeline, pathology, biomarkers, staging at diagnosis, treatment history, social/medical history, and any image references.\\n2. PatientStatus \u2014 to synthesize current patient status (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG) from PatientHistory.\\n3. Radiology \u2014 to provide the latest imaging findings (CT, MRI, X-ray). Radiology will need image files or image reports; PatientHistory should supply those or reference them.\\n4. ClinicalTrials \u2014 to list appropriate clinical trials matching the patient status (optional but useful for tumor board).\\n5. ReportCreation \u2014 to assemble the tumor-board-ready Word document using the collected timeline, clinical summary, medical history, imaging and pathology findings, treatment history, and clinical trials listing.\\n\\nImportant rule to follow: After each agent completes their task, they should yield the chat back to me (Orchestrator) by ending their reply with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nUser confirmation\\nUser, may I proceed with this plan to retrieve and synthesize the record for patient_4? Please confirm. If you want any additional sections included in the report (e.g., multidisciplinary recommendations, specific imaging sequences, or certain trial types), mention them now.\\n\\nRequests to agents\\nPatientHistory, proceed with patient ID: patient_4. Please provide:\\n- Complete patient timeline relevant to the cancer episode (dates of diagnosis, staging, major events)\\n- Primary site and histology\\n- Biomarker results (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, PD-L1, BRAF, MSI, others if available)\\n- Stage at diagnosis (include TNM if available)\\n- Treatment history (surgery, chemo, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, radiation \u2014 include dates and responses)\\n- Latest pathology report summary\\n- Latest imaging reports or image files (CT/MRI/PET/X-ray) or links \u2014 clearly label the latest study and date\\n- Relevant past medical history and social history (smoking, performance status if available)\\n- Any notes about ongoing clinical issues or comorbidities\\n\\nPatientHistory, what (if anything) do you need from the User to complete this? If you can proceed with patient_4, please provide the requested details. Then end with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nOnce PatientHistory responds, I will call PatientStatus to synthesize the current status, then Radiology for imaging interpretation, then ClinicalTrials (if desired), and finally ReportCreation to export the Word document.\\n\\nPlease confirm you want me to proceed, User, and PatientHistory please begin with patient_4.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
