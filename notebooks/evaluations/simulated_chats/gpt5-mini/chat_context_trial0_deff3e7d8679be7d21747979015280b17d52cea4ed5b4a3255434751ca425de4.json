PatientHistory \u2014 gather the complete patient timeline, demographics, staging, pathology, biomarkers, treatment history, comorbidities, social history and any notes needed for the tumor board. (This is the foundational data other agents need.)\\n  2. Radiology \u2014 review and summarize imaging (CT, PET, X\u2011ray) and provide radiology impressions. (Needs images or image reports from PatientHistory/user.)\\n  3. PatientStatus \u2014 synthesize a current status summary (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG). (Requires outputs from PatientHistory and Radiology.)\\n  4. ClinicalGuidelines \u2014 provide guideline-relevant considerations (note: not treatment plans) based on the PatientStatus.\\n  5. ClinicalTrials \u2014 identify trial options relevant to the PatientStatus.\\n  6. MedicalResearch \u2014 provide background literature or recent studies on chosen topics/trials if requested.\\n  7. ReportCreation \u2014 assemble the tumor board Word document using all collected inputs.\\n\\nImportant rule to follow now and for every agent reply:\\n- After completing their task each agent should explicitly yield back to me by ending their response with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nNext steps and what I need now\\n- PatientHistory, proceed with patient_4. Tell me what specific items you need to produce a complete timeline and summary for the tumor board (for example: pathology report PDF, operative notes, chemo/radiation start and stop dates, biomarker results, imaging reports or DICOMs, ECOG). Provide the specific list of documents/data you require, and then provide the patient_4 timeline/details you already have access to.\\n- Radiology, prepare to analyze images/reports. Radiology, what image types/files or reports do you need for a meaningful radiology summary (CT chest/abdomen/pelvis, PET-CT, chest X\u2011ray DICOMs or report text)? State exactly what you need.\\n- PatientStatus, wait until PatientHistory and Radiology provide data; when ready you will synthesize the current status. Confirm the exact data fields you need (age, stage, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).\\n- ClinicalGuidelines and ClinicalTrials, wait for PatientStatus output; confirm you will only provide guideline-aligned considerations and trial matches respectively and state any additional specifics you need.\\n- ReportCreation, confirm the document elements you will include (timeline, clinical summary, medical history, social history, cancer type, CT findings, X\u2011ray findings, pathology findings, treatment plan options/considerations, clinical trials list) and any format needs.\\n\\nUser, please provide the following for patient_4 (as available)\\n- Confirm: do you consent to share de-identified medical records for tumor board preparation?\\n- Age and sex of the patient\\n- Primary cancer site, histology, TNM staging (if available)\\n- ECOG performance status\\n- Biomarker results (e.g., PD-L1, EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MSI/TMB, relevant panels)\\n- Treatment history (surgery dates, chemo regimens, radiation, immunotherapy\u2014start/stop dates)\\n- Recent imaging or imaging reports (CT/PET/X\u2011ray) \u2014 attach DICOMs or PDFs if possible\\n- Pathology report(s) and operative reports (PDFs)\\n- Comorbidities and relevant labs (creatinine, LFTs, CBC) if relevant to clinical status\\n- Any specific questions or focus for the tumor board (e.g., second opinion on resectability, trial eligibility, progression vs pseudoprogression)\\n\\nPlease confirm you want me to proceed with the plan above. If yes, PatientHistory \u2014 state what you need and then provide the patient_4 data you have. Remember to end with: back to you: Orchestrator\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
