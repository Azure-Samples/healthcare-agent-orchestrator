USER:
Identify and list active clinical trials that patient_4 is eligible for, based on tumor type, stage, KRAS mutation status, treatment history, and geographic location. Include trial phase and contact info.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Plan and participant order

I will coordinate the team to identify active clinical trials for patient_4. Here is the plan and the order of participants:
1. PatientHistory — provide the patient timeline and key data (age, primary site, stage, histology, biomarkers including KRAS status, treatment history, ECOG, prior imaging/pathology notes). I will ask PatientHistory what additional info they need to produce that summary.
2. PatientStatus — create a consolidated current patient-status summary usable for trial matching (needs the items listed above from PatientHistory).
3. ClinicalTrials — search and list active clinical trials the patient is eligible for (needs the PatientStatus summary and geographic location).
4. ClinicalGuidelines (if needed) — will *not* provide treatment recommendations but can clarify guideline context for eligibility criteria if requested.
5. ReportCreation — if you want, prepare a document of the findings for tumor board review (needs the full timeline and trial list).
6. MedicalResearch — if you want deeper literature or investigational background about specific trial mechanisms or KRAS-targeted strategies.

Important rules
- Each agent, after completing their task, should yield back to me by ending their reply with: back to you: Orchestrator
- I will not provide clinical recommendations or treatment plans — only coordination and information gathering to list trials and eligibility.
- I will ask the user for missing pieces of information explicitly.

User input needed now
User, can you provide the patient_4 geographic location (city and state or country) so we can limit trial searches to suitable distances? Also please confirm whether the record for patient_4 is up-to-date and whether you can share/confirm these items if available: age, ECOG performance status, and any recent imaging or pathology reports.

Next step — PatientHistory
*PatientHistory*, proceed with patient_4: please provide the patient timeline and the following items (or let me know what you need to access to provide them): age, primary tumor site, stage (TNM or summary stage), histology, biomarkers including KRAS mutation (specific variant if known), prior treatments (surgery, chemo, targeted, immunotherapy; include dates), and ECOG performance status. If you need any other identifiers or records to pull this data, state what you need.

PatientHistory, after you respond, please yield back to me with: back to you: Orchestrator
