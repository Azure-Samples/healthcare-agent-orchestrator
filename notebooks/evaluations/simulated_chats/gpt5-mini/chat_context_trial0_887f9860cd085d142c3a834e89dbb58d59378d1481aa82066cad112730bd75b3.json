If there are study IDs or accession numbers please include them.\\n\\nQuestions to the agents (please respond with what you need to proceed)\\n- PatientHistory, proceed with patient_4: what specific information or access do you need from the user or records to retrieve the latest imaging studies and radiology reports? Please confirm you can supply the images and the radiologist\u2019s report once you have that info. After your reply, end with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\n- Radiology, once PatientHistory provides the images and the radiologist\u2019s report: what input do you need (file types, any clinical context, preferred imaging windows/series) to run the imaging tool, produce AI-generated findings, and perform a structured comparison to the radiologist\u2019s report? After your reply, end with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nPlease confirm\\n- User, do you agree with this plan and can you upload the requested imaging files and reports? If you want to add any clinical context (symptoms, prior imaging comparisons, prior known lesions), please include that as well.\\n\\nNext steps after I get the files\\n- PatientHistory will retrieve/attach the imaging and report.\\n- Radiology will analyze the images with the imaging tool, produce AI findings, and compare those to the radiologist\u2019s report.\\n- I will then summarize any discrepancies or additional findings and ask if you want further review or a tumor\u2011board style report.\\n\\nWaiting for the user to upload images/reports and the agents to confirm what they need.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
