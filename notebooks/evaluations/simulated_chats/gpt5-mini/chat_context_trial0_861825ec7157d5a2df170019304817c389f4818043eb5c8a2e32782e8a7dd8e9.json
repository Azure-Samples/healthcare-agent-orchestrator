PatientHistory \u2014 provide the patient timeline and available notes (requires the patient ID which you provided).\\n  2. PatientStatus \u2014 synthesize current status (needs age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).\\n  3. Radiology \u2014 review and summarize imaging (needs any image files: CT, MRI, X-ray, PET; or imaging reports).\\n  4. ClinicalGuidelines \u2014 prepare guideline-based discussion points (needs PatientStatus output).\\n  5. ClinicalTrials \u2014 search for relevant trials (needs PatientStatus output).\\n  6. MedicalResearch \u2014 optional deeper literature search if a specific question arises (needs a keyword/topic).\\n  7. ReportCreation \u2014 compile the tumor-board Word document (needs all above outputs: timeline, summaries, imaging findings, pathology, proposed plan/choices, trials).\\n- Important rule for this workflow: after each agent completes their task, they must return control to me and explicitly say: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n\\nWhat I need now to start\\n- PatientHistory, proceed with patient_4 and provide the patient timeline and available notes (history, prior pathology reports, biomarker data, treatment history, prior imaging reports). After your response, say \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n- User, please provide the following items if available:\\n  - Confirm you want to proceed with Patient ID patient_4.\\n  - Age, sex.\\n  - Primary cancer site and histology (if known).\\n  - Current clinical stage (or TNM).\\n  - ECOG performance status.\\n  - Full treatment history (surgeries, systemic therapies, radiation with dates).\\n  - Pathology reports and biomarker results (PD-L1, molecular panel, HER2, MSI, etc).\\n  - Imaging files or reports (CT, PET-CT, MRI, X-rays). If you have DICOMs, indicate how to share them; if only reports/PDFs, please upload.\\n  - Any relevant comorbidities, medications, and social history (smoking, alcohol).\\n  - Any specific questions or goals for the tumor board (e.g., consider resection, change systemic therapy, clinical trial enrollment).\\n- Radiology, stand by to receive any imaging files the user provides. After your review, summarize key imaging findings and say \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n\\nNext steps after I have the above\\n- I will request PatientStatus to synthesize the current state from PatientHistory.\\n- Then ClinicalGuidelines and ClinicalTrials will generate materials for tumor-board discussion.\\n- Finally ReportCreation will assemble a Word document for the tumor board.\\n\\nPlease confirm\\n- User, do you confirm proceeding with this plan and can you supply the requested documents/data for patient_4?\\n- PatientHistory, proceed with patient_4 and indicate if you need any additional identifiers or documents beyond the patient ID. After responding, say \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
