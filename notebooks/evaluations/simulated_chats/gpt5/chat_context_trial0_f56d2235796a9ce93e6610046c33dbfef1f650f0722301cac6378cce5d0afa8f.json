After each step, the agent will yield control back to me. Each agent, after completing their task, should yield the chat back to you (Orchestrator) by saying: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\\n\\nProposed order of participants and purpose:\\n1) PatientHistory: Confirm what inputs they need (expected: just patient ID). Then retrieve a comprehensive patient timeline and history for patient_4, including demographics, diagnosis details, staging, histology, biomarkers, pathology summaries, treatment history, ECOG performance status, comorbidities, medications, allergies, social history, and available imaging and pathology reports/files.\\n   - Instruction to agent: PatientHistory, confirm you only need the patient ID. If yes, proceed with patient_4 and include all items listed above. After completion, say \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\\n\\n2) Radiology: Analyze any chest X-ray images provided by PatientHistory. If images are not available, note missing data. If CT/MRI findings are only available as text in reports, summarize those findings clearly as coming from report text (no new image analysis).\\n   - Instruction to agent: Radiology, you need imaging files (preferably chest X-ray) or reports. Please analyze any images provided by PatientHistory and summarize key findings, and summarize CT/MRI findings from reports if present. After completion, say \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\\n\\n3) PatientStatus: Compile the current status using data from PatientHistory (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, prior therapies, ECOG).\\n   - Instruction to agent: PatientStatus, you need age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG, from PatientHistory. Create a concise current status summary. After completion, say \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\\n\\n4) ClinicalTrials: Search and list relevant clinical trials based on PatientStatus. If location is not provided, either use a broad search or wait for location input.\\n   - Instruction to agent: ClinicalTrials, you need the PatientStatus. Also note: we will provide location preferences if available. Provide trial options with key eligibility highlights. After completion, say \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\\n\\n5) ReportCreation: Assemble a tumor board Word document including: patient timeline, clinical summary (from PatientStatus), medical history, social history, cancer type, radiology (X-ray/CT) findings, pathology findings, and clinical trials. For the \u201ctreatment plan\u201d section, include \u201cto be determined by tumor board\u201d unless the user requests a general, non-directive guideline summary.\\n   - Instruction to agent: ReportCreation, you need the items gathered above. Produce a well-structured Word document suitable for tumor board review. After completion, say \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\\n\\nOptional steps (only if the user requests):\\n6) MedicalResearch: Provide a brief literature summary on a specified topic (e.g., new therapies, biomarkers, or staging updates relevant to the patient\u2019s diagnosis).\\n   - Instruction to agent: MedicalResearch, you need a keyword/topic. After completion, say \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\\n\\n7) ClinicalGuidelines: Provide a high-level, non-directive overview of guideline-based options relevant to the patient\u2019s status (no prescriptive treatment plan).\\n   - Instruction to agent: ClinicalGuidelines, you need PatientStatus. Provide a general overview without directive recommendations. After completion, say \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\\n\\nUser, can you please confirm this plan and provide the following so we can proceed efficiently?\\n- Preferred trial search location(s) and willingness to travel (e.g., city/state or zip, max distance).\\n- Any imaging files you want included (chest X-ray or CT). If you have files, we\u2019ll prompt you to upload them; otherwise we\u2019ll rely on reports from PatientHistory.\\n- Any specific questions or decision points you want the tumor board to address (e.g., surgical candidacy, sequencing of therapies, biomarker testing clarification).\\n- Would you like us to include:\\n  - A high-level guideline overview (non-directive)?\\n  - A brief literature review section from MedicalResearch?\\n\\nIf you approve, I will start with PatientHistory for patient_4.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
