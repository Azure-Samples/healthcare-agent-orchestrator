Each agent, after completing their task, should yield the chat back to me. Specifically, each agent will say: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d after their response.\\n\\nPlan and order:\\n1) PatientHistory\\n- Purpose: Retrieve the latest CT and chest X-ray (CXR) imaging studies for patient_4, along with the official radiologist reports. Provide study dates, accession numbers, and links/files for the images so they can be analyzed.\\n- What they need: The patient ID (provided: patient_4). If multiple CT types exist, we\u2019ll prioritize chest CT. If only non-chest CTs are available, list the most recent CTs and we\u2019ll decide how to proceed.\\n\\n2) Radiology\\n- Purpose: Use the imaging tool to analyze the provided CT and CXR, generate AI-derived findings (including key measurements/locations), and return a structured summary.\\n- What they need: The actual images or links to them from PatientHistory, plus any pertinent metadata (study date, series descriptions).\\n\\n3) Orchestrator (me)\\n- Purpose: Compare the AI-generated findings with the radiologist\u2019s official report and summarize discrepancies or additional findings. I will clearly flag any potential mismatches or new observations.\\n\\nUser, please confirm:\\n- May we proceed with retrieving the latest CT (preferably chest CT) and CXR for patient_4 along with the corresponding radiology reports?\\n- If you have any constraints (e.g., use only studies after a certain date, or specific accession numbers), please share them now.\\n\\nIf you confirm, I will proceed as follows.\\n\\nPatientHistory, proceed with:\\n- For patient_4, identify and retrieve the most recent chest X-ray and the most recent CT (prioritize chest CT; if unavailable, list the latest available CT modalities).\\n- Provide: study dates/times, accession numbers, report texts, and accessible image links/files for both studies.\\n- If multiple relevant series exist for the CT, list the series descriptions so Radiology can choose appropriately.\\nPlease respond and then say, \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
