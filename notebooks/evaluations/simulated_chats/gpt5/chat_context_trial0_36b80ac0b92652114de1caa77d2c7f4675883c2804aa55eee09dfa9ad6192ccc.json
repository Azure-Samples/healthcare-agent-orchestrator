If images are available, provide interpretations; if only reports exist, summarize key findings.\\n3) PatientStatus: Summarize current status (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG performance status) based on PatientHistory.\\n4) ClinicalTrials: Provide relevant active clinical trials based on PatientStatus, with key eligibility and site info.\\n5) ReportCreation: Produce a tumor board Word document including: patient timeline, clinical summary, medical and social history, cancer type, CT and X-ray findings, pathology findings, documented treatment-to-date, and relevant clinical trials. We will list \u201coutstanding questions for tumor board\u201d rather than making any treatment recommendations.\\n\\nOptional:\\n6) MedicalResearch: If you want a brief literature summary (e.g., on biomarkers or modalities relevant to this case), we can add this as an appendix.\\n\\nUser, please confirm:\\n- Do you approve this plan and order?\\n- Do you want the optional MedicalResearch appendix included?\\n- Do you have any preferences for ClinicalTrials search (e.g., geographic region, maximum travel distance, sponsor types)?\\n- If you have any imaging files not already in the chart, can you provide them now?\\n\\nIf approved, I will begin with PatientHistory for patient_4.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
