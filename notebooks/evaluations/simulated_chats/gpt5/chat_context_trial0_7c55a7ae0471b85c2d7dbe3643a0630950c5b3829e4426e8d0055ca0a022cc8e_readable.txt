USER:
Identify and list active clinical trials that patient_4 is eligible for, based on tumor type, stage, KRAS mutation status, treatment history, and geographic location. Include trial phase and contact info.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Plan and order of participants:
- Step 1: Gather and confirm required inputs
  - I will confirm what each agent needs and collect any missing information.
- Step 2: PatientHistory
  - Retrieve the complete record for patient_4 (timeline, tumor type, stage, histology, KRAS mutation status and other biomarkers, treatment history, age, ECOG, and geographic location).
- Step 3: PatientStatus
  - Synthesize a concise patient status profile needed for trial matching.
- Step 4: ClinicalTrials
  - Identify active, recruiting clinical trials that match patient_4’s tumor type, stage, KRAS mutation status, treatment history, and geographic location. Provide NCT ID, trial phase, brief rationale for eligibility, trial locations, and site contact information.
- Step 5: Summary back to you
  - I will summarize the findings for quick review.

Important rule for all agents:
- Each agent, after completing their task, should yield the chat back to me (Orchestrator) by saying: “back to you: Orchestrator”.

User, please confirm this plan and provide:
- Patient’s preferred geographic location (city/state/country) and maximum travel distance.
- Any location constraints (e.g., country-only, specific institutions, tele-trials acceptable).
- Any trial phase preferences (e.g., Phase 1/2/3) or exclusions.
- Permission to search public registries (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov) for the most current listings.

Next, I’ll check with each agent about what they need, then proceed.

PatientHistory, proceed with confirming the inputs you need to retrieve the full record for “patient_4”. After confirming, I will provide them to you. Remember to end with: “back to you: Orchestrator”.
