Each agent, after completing their task, should yield the chat back to me (Orchestrator) by saying: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\nProposed order and purpose:\\n1) PatientHistory\\n- Purpose: Retrieve the full chart for Patient ID: patient_4, including demographics, cancer primary site and histology, stage at diagnosis, biomarker/molecular results, treatment history, ECOG performance status, relevant pathology, and all imaging records/reports (CT, X-ray, etc.). If available, provide actual chest X-ray image files for review.\\n- What PatientHistory needs: Patient ID (provided: patient_4).\\n- Action: PatientHistory, confirm you can pull the complete record for patient_4 and list the data elements you will return. After responding, say \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\n2) PatientStatus\\n- Purpose: Summarize the current clinical status (age, primary site, histology, stage at diagnosis and current stage if available, biomarkers, treatment history/response, ECOG).\\n- What PatientStatus needs: age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG performance status (to be supplied by PatientHistory).\\n- Action: PatientStatus, confirm that once PatientHistory provides these fields, you can generate a concise status summary for patient_4. After responding, say \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\n3) Radiology\\n- Purpose: Provide radiology insights on the latest imaging findings. If chest X-ray images are available, perform image analysis; otherwise, synthesize from the most recent imaging reports (e.g., CT) provided by PatientHistory.\\n- What Radiology needs: Imaging files (preferably chest X-ray images) and/or most recent radiology reports (from PatientHistory).\\n- Action: Radiology, confirm acceptable image formats and that you can analyze chest X-rays and summarize CT findings from reports if no images are available. After responding, say \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\n4) ClinicalTrials\\n- Purpose: Provide a brief, relevant snapshot of open clinical trials that match the patient\u2019s status for inclusion in the tumor board document (optional but commonly included in tumor board packets).\\n- What ClinicalTrials needs: PatientStatus summary (from PatientStatus).\\n- Action: ClinicalTrials, confirm you can generate a brief list of trial options once PatientStatus is available. After responding, say \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\n5) ReportCreation\\n- Purpose: Assemble a formatted Word document suitable for tumor board, including: patient timeline, clinical summary, medical and social history, cancer type, CT and X-ray findings, pathology findings, biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history to date, and a brief clinical trials snapshot if approved.\\n- What ReportCreation needs: Outputs from PatientHistory, PatientStatus, Radiology, and (if approved) ClinicalTrials.\\n- Action: ReportCreation, confirm you can generate a .docx and provide a downloadable file or share link once the inputs are supplied. After responding, say \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\nUser, please confirm:\\n- Confirm we should proceed with this plan for Patient ID: patient_4.\\n- Do you want a short \u201cRelevant Clinical Trials\u201d section included in the document? Yes/No.\\n- If you have any external imaging (e.g., recent chest X-ray files) not in the record, would you like to upload them for Radiology to review?\\n- Any formatting preferences for the Word document (e.g., institutional template, logo placeholders, specific section order)?\\n\\nOnce you confirm, I will instruct PatientHistory to begin.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
