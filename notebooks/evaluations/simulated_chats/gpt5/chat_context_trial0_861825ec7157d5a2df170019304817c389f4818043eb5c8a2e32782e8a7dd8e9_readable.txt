Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Here’s the plan to prepare the tumor board package for Patient ID: patient_4. I’ll coordinate the following agents in this order. Important: Each agent, after completing their task, should yield the chat back to me by saying “back to you: Orchestrator.”

1) PatientHistory
- Purpose: Retrieve the comprehensive chart for patient_4: demographics, medical/surgical history, social history, oncology timeline, pathology (with histology and biomarkers), staging, treatments and responses, meds/allergies, comorbidities, ECOG, and a list of imaging studies. Include any available chest X-ray images (files/links) and CT scan findings.
- What they need: Patient ID (provided).
- Output: Structured timeline and source documents/links.

2) PatientStatus
- Purpose: Create a concise, structured status summary (age, primary site, histology, biomarkers, TNM/stage, disease sites, ECOG, prior therapies with dates/responses, comorbidities, and current clinical status).
- What they need: Data from PatientHistory.

3) Radiology
- Purpose: If chest X-ray images are available, provide radiology insights and impressions; if not, specify what’s missing.
- What they need: Chest X-ray images (from PatientHistory or from you if you upload).

4) ClinicalGuidelines
- Purpose: Provide guideline-aligned treatment options based on PatientStatus for tumor board discussion.
- What they need: PatientStatus.

5) ClinicalTrials
- Purpose: Identify relevant clinical trials and assess fit based on key inclusion/exclusion factors.
- What they need: PatientStatus.

6) ReportCreation
- Purpose: Generate a tumor board Word document containing timeline, clinical summary, medical and social history, cancer type, CT and X-ray findings, pathology findings, guideline-aligned options, and trial opportunities.
- What they need: Patient timeline, clinical summary, medical/social history, cancer type, CT/X-ray findings, pathology findings, treatment plan options (from ClinicalGuidelines), and clinical trials.

7) MedicalResearch (optional)
- Purpose: Perform a targeted literature review on any specific tumor board question (e.g., biomarker-driven therapy evidence, sequencing after specific regimens).
- What they need: A keyword or topic you choose.

User, please confirm:
- Do you approve this plan and order?
- Should we include both ClinicalGuidelines and ClinicalTrials sections in the report?
- Do you want the optional MedicalResearch deep-dive, and if so, on what specific question or keywords?

Additionally:
- User, can you provide any imaging files for patient_4 (chest X-ray DICOM/JPEG/PNG) and any recent CT reports or pathology PDFs not already in the chart?
- User, do you have any special questions you want highlighted for the tumor board (e.g., resectability, systemic therapy options, trial eligibility, palliative approaches)?

If you confirm, I will proceed by asking:
- PatientHistory, proceed with retrieving the full chart for patient_4 as outlined. After responding, please say “back to you: Orchestrator.”
