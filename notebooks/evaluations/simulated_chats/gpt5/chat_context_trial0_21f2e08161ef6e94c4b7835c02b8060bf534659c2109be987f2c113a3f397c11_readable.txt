USER:
Based on the full clinical picture of patient_4â€”including stage, biomarkers, treatment response, and recent imagingâ€”generate a short report estimating prognosis and possible progression pathways.

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Here’s a proposed plan to generate the short prognosis and progression-pathways report for patient_4. I will coordinate each step and ensure each agent hands control back to me.

Plan and order of participants:
1) PatientHistory
- Purpose: Retrieve the complete clinical record for patient_4, including timeline, staging, histology, biomarkers, treatment history and responses, ECOG, comorbidities, labs, and recent imaging reports/links/images.
- Instruction: Each agent, after completing their task, should yield the chat back to me by saying: “back to you: Orchestrator.”
- First, per our process, I will ask PatientHistory what information they need to fulfill this request.

2) PatientStatus
- Purpose: Synthesize the current status (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG) into a concise status summary we can use to frame prognosis.
- Instruction: Yield back with “back to you: Orchestrator.”

3) Radiology (optional, if we have imaging files)
- Purpose: If actual imaging files (especially chest X-rays) are available, provide radiology insights from the images to complement the imaging reports. If we only have text reports, we may not invoke Radiology.
- Instruction: Yield back with “back to you: Orchestrator.”

4) MedicalResearch
- Purpose: Provide evidence-based context for prognosis and typical progression pathways given the specific cancer type, stage, and biomarkers (e.g., survival ranges, factors that influence prognosis, common sites/routes of progression).
- Input needed: A concise topic derived from PatientStatus (e.g., “Prognosis and progression patterns in [cancer type], stage [X], [biomarker profile]”).
- Instruction: Yield back with “back to you: Orchestrator.”

5) Orchestrator (me)
- Purpose: Compile a short report estimating prognosis (qualitative and, where supported by evidence, quantitative ranges) and outlining plausible progression pathways, explicitly citing the factors from patient_4’s profile that drive the estimate. No treatment recommendations will be provided.

User, can you please confirm:
- That the patient ID is patient_4 and you authorize me to retrieve their chart for this purpose?
- Whether you can upload or share any recent imaging files (especially chest X-rays) you want Radiology to analyze; otherwise we will rely on imaging reports from PatientHistory.
- Your preference for the report style: primarily qualitative, or include literature-based quantitative ranges where available?

If you confirm, I will begin with PatientHistory.

Ahead of starting, per our process:
- PatientHistory, please confirm exactly what inputs you need to retrieve the comprehensive record for this task and whether the patient ID alone (patient_4) is sufficient. After confirming, say: “back to you: Orchestrator.”

---

USER:
PatientHistory: Please confirm exactly what inputs you need to retrieve the comprehensive record for patient_4 and whether the patient ID alone is sufficient. Specifically, outline:
- What identifiers you require (e.g., MRN, DOB, facility/EHR instance) and whether patient_4 is enough to locate the chart.
- Data sources you can access (EHR notes, pathology, genomics/molecular profiling, pharmacy/administration records, lab systems, PACS for imaging, tumor board summaries).
- Date range defaults (full lifetime vs. last 24 months) and whether you can capture prior care from outside institutions.
- Whether you can retrieve actual imaging files (DICOM) or only radiology reports if files are not provided here.
- Any consent/privacy constraints to proceed and whether explicit user authorization is needed now.
- Expected output format and organization (timeline, staging, histology, biomarkers, treatment lines/responses, ECOG, comorbidities, labs, imaging summaries/links).

After confirming, please reply with: “back to you: Orchestrator.”

ASSISTANT (agent id: PatientHistory):
- Identifiers required and sufficiency of patient_4:
  - Within this workspace, the patient_id "patient_4" is sufficient to locate and retrieve the chart and associated assets.
  - Optional identifiers (if available) that can help disambiguate across multiple systems include MRN, DOB, and facility/EHR instance, but they are not required here unless you specify a different patient or there are multiple matches.
  - I will continue to use the last provided patient ID (patient_4) until you change it.

- Data sources I can access:
  - EHR clinical notes (oncology, pulmonology, primary care, consults, procedures).
  - Pathology and cytology reports.
  - Genomics/molecular profiling (e.g., NGS, PD-L1).
  - Pharmacy/administration records (chemotherapy/immunotherapy administrations, premeds).
  - Laboratory systems (CBC, CMP, thyroid function, etc.).
  - Radiology reports and available imaging file pointers from the internal data store.
  - Tumor board summaries/second-opinion notes if present in the record.
  - All sources are presented with preserved [text](url) links where available.

- Date range defaults and outside records:
  - Default: full longitudinal record available in the data store (no time truncation).
  - I can filter to any custom window (e.g., last 24 months) on request.
  - Prior care from outside institutions is captured if those records have been imported into this data store; otherwise, I would need you to provide uploads or authorize an integrated connection to the external source to ingest them.

- Imaging retrieval:
  - I can list and retrieve imaging assets available in the internal data store (DICOM if present; otherwise, non-DICOM formats such as PNG/JPEG).
  - If actual image files are not present, I will rely on radiology report text and links.
  - You can upload DICOM studies or provide access links if you want imaging review beyond the reports.

- Consent/privacy constraints:
  - I operate under role-based access within this environment. Proceeding relies on your confirmation that you are authorized to access patient_4’s chart.
  - By providing the patient ID, you have authorized retrieval for this session. No external systems are queried without explicit authorization and configured connectors.
  - I preserve PHI contained within the dataset and do not expose images inline without request; links are provided as stored.

- Expected output format and organization:
  - Chronological patient timeline with original source links preserved in [text](url) format.
  - Status snapshot: demographics, diagnosis, stage, ECOG, comorbidities.
  - Pathology/histology and biomarkers (NGS, PD-L1, relevant targets).
  - Treatment history by line, with dates, regimens, responses, and key adverse events.
  - Imaging summary: key findings and impressions with report links; separate manifest of available image files.
  - Key labs and trends relevant to oncology care.
  - Care coordination notes, procedures, and consult highlights.
  - When asked to present the clinical data, I will begin with the specified statement and present the original timeline output; I do not embed images inline.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Thank you, PatientHistory. Plan update and next steps:

- We will now have PatientStatus synthesize the current status of patient_4 to ground the prognosis assessment.
- If imaging files beyond reports are needed, we will optionally involve Radiology, but given the available PET/CT reports and one chest X-ray image, we may rely on the reports unless you, User, prefer Radiology review.
- Then we will ask MedicalResearch to provide evidence-based context for prognosis and common progression pathways tailored to patient_4’s cancer type, stage, and biomarker profile.
- I will compile a short prognosis and progression-pathways report. No treatment recommendations will be provided.

As a reminder of the process rule: Each agent, after completing their task, should yield the chat back to me (Orchestrator) by saying: “back to you: Orchestrator.”

PatientStatus, proceed with synthesizing the current status for patient_4. Please confirm what inputs you need and whether the following are sufficient; if anything is missing, list it explicitly and I will obtain it from PatientHistory:

- Age/sex: 59-year-old female (as of 2021-03-27).
- Primary site/histology: Left lung, non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma favored.
- Stage: T4 N3 M1a (Stage IVA).
- Biomarkers: KRAS p.G12C mutation; PD-L1 negative; other co-mutations (e.g., STK11, KEAP1, TP53) not documented in current record.
- Treatment history:
  - 2020-05: Weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel.
  - 2020-06-10 to 2020-09-24: q3-week carboplatin/paclitaxel/pembrolizumab x6 cycles.
  - 2020-12-28 to 2021-03-22: Maintenance pembrolizumab.
  - Responses: PET/CT partial responses on 2020-08-04 and 2020-10-22; progression on CT 2021-02-15 and PET/CT 2021-03-22 (increased FDG-avid left lung mass 4.1 cm with left hilar/infrahilar nodes).
  - Current plan: Discontinue pembrolizumab; initiate adagrasib (KRAS G12C inhibitor).
- ECOG: Documented ECOG 1 at chemotherapy education (2020-04-30). Most recent ECOG not explicitly documented; please note as “last known ECOG 1” unless PatientHistory has a later value.
- Comorbidities/events: Immune-related hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine; TSH normalized by 2021-02-08, dose adjusted 2021-03-01), dysphagia due to Schatzki’s ring (EGD balloon dilation 2021-03-11), coronary artery disease noted on CT with cardiology follow-up planned.

Deliverable: A concise status snapshot including any assumptions or gaps (e.g., current ECOG, presence/absence of brain metastases imaging), suitable for downstream prognosis context.

After your response, please say: “back to you: Orchestrator.”

User, if you prefer we also involve Radiology to review the available chest X-ray image, please let me know; otherwise, we will rely on the PET/CT and CT reports for imaging context.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Thank you, PatientStatus.

Next steps per plan:
- I will ask PatientHistory to clarify a few gaps that affect prognosis framing (basis for M1a, any CNS imaging, latest ECOG).
- Then I will engage MedicalResearch to provide evidence-based context on prognosis and common progression pathways for Stage IVA KRAS G12C–mutated NSCLC after progression on chemo-immunotherapy.
- I will then compile a short prognosis and progression-pathways report. No treatment recommendations will be provided.

Reminder of the process rule: Each agent, after completing their task, should yield the chat back to me by saying: “back to you: Orchestrator.”

PatientHistory, proceed with:
- Confirm the documented basis for M1a staging in patient_4 (e.g., contralateral pulmonary nodules vs pleural/pericardial involvement).
- Check for any CNS imaging (brain MRI or CT) and summarize findings/dates if present; if absent, confirm that no CNS imaging is in record through 2021-03-27.
- Identify the most recent ECOG/performance status documentation and date.

After responding, say: “back to you: Orchestrator.”

User, if you would like us to also involve Radiology to review the available chest X-ray image, please let me know; otherwise we will proceed based on the PET/CT and CT reports.

USER:
PatientHistory: Please retrieve from the chart for patient_4 and summarize the following with brief source citations (report titles/dates and [text](url) links where available):
- Basis for M1a staging (e.g., contralateral pulmonary nodules, pleural/pericardial involvement, or separate tumor nodule in the contralateral lung).
- CNS imaging: list any brain MRI or head CT studies with dates and key findings; if absent through 2021-03-27, explicitly state no CNS imaging on record through that date.
- Most recent documented ECOG/performance status and date.

After responding, please say: “back to you: Orchestrator.”

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Thank you, PatientHistory and PatientStatus.

Plan continuation:
- Next, I will engage MedicalResearch to compile evidence-based context (survival ranges and common progression patterns) tailored to patient_4’s profile.
- Then I will synthesize a short prognosis and progression-pathways report. No treatment recommendations will be provided.

Reminder of the process rule: Each agent, after completing their task, should yield the chat back to me by saying: “back to you: Orchestrator.”

MedicalResearch, proceed with the following request. First, confirm if you need any additional inputs beyond what’s listed below. If the inputs are sufficient, please provide a concise, citation-supported summary addressing each bullet, and include trial names/years and representative ranges (not prescriptive recommendations):

Inputs for context:
- Cancer: Non–small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma favored.
- Stage: IVA (T4 N3 M1a), with M1a basis = contralateral pulmonary nodules at diagnosis; no documented malignant pleural/pericardial disease.
- Biomarkers: KRAS p.G12C mutation; PD-L1 negative; co-mutations not documented.
- Treatment course: Induction chemo-immunotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel/pembrolizumab) with partial response; progression on maintenance pembrolizumab by 2021-03-22; plan to start a KRAS G12C inhibitor (adagrasib).
- Performance status: Last documented ECOG 1 (2020-04-30), no later PS recorded.
- CNS imaging: None on record through 2021-03-27 (no documented brain mets status).

Deliverables:
1) Prognosis context for metastatic KRAS G12C–mutated NSCLC after progression on chemo-IO, ECOG 0–1, PD-L1 negative:
   - Typical median PFS and OS ranges on KRAS G12C inhibitors in the post–chemo-IO setting (e.g., adagrasib KRYSTAL-1, sotorasib CodeBreaK 100/200). Include approximate medians and response rates with citations.
   - How M1a (contralateral pulmonary nodules only) at baseline compares prognostically to other M1 categories, if available.
   - Prognostic impact (if any) of PD-L1 negativity and common co-mutations (STK11/KEAP1/TP53), noting that co-mutations are unknown here.

2) Common progression pathways/patterns for KRAS G12C–mutant NSCLC:
   - Pre- and post–G12C inhibitor: common sites (thoracic/mediastinal, lung, brain, liver, bone, adrenal) and frequency/likelihood where reported.
   - CNS risk in KRAS-mutant adenocarcinoma and any data on intracranial activity of adagrasib or sotorasib (qualitative summary with key references).
   - Typical resistance mechanisms to G12C inhibitors (on-target/off-target) that correlate with progression patterns (high level).

3) Brief, literature-based qualitative prognosis framing for a patient similar to patient_4 (ECOG 1, post–chemo-IO starting a G12C inhibitor), expressed as ranges and modifiers, not as a treatment plan.

Please include references (trial/registry names; year; journal where possible). After your response, say: “back to you: Orchestrator.”

User, unless you’d like Radiology to review the available chest X-ray image, we will proceed to synthesize the short report after MedicalResearch responds.

---

USER:
MedicalResearch: Thank you. The inputs provided are sufficient. Below is a concise, citation-supported summary.

1) Prognosis context in previously treated (post–chemo-IO) KRAS G12C–mutated NSCLC, ECOG 0–1, PD-L1 negative
- KRAS G12C inhibitors (post–chemo-IO):
  - Adagrasib (KRYSTAL-1, phase II, previously treated NSCLC):
    - ORR ~43%, DCR ~80%.
    - Median PFS ~6.5 months; median OS ~12.6 months; median DoR ~8.5 months.
    - Reference: KRYSTAL-1 (NEJM 2022).
  - Sotorasib (CodeBreaK 100, phase II, previously treated NSCLC):
    - ORR ~37%; median PFS ~6.8 months; median OS ~12.5 months; median DoR ~10–11 months on update.
    - Reference: CodeBreaK 100 (NEJM 2021; JCO 2022 update).
  - Sotorasib vs docetaxel (CodeBreaK 200, phase III):
    - Median PFS 5.6 vs 4.5 months (HR ~0.66); ORR 28% vs 13%; median OS not significantly different (~10.6 vs ~11.3 months, impacted by crossover).
    - Reference: CodeBreaK 200 (NEJM 2023).
  - Takeaway: In ECOG 0–1 patients after chemo-IO, KRAS G12C inhibitors typically yield median PFS ~5–7 months and median OS ~10–13 months from inhibitor start, with ORR ~30–45%.
- M1a vs other M1 categories:
  - Across IASLC 8th-edition TNM analyses, M1a disease (contralateral pulmonary nodules and/or pleural/pericardial involvement) has better prognosis than M1b (single extrathoracic) and M1c (multiple extrathoracic) disease. While absolute medians vary by treatment era, relative ranking is consistent (M1a > M1b > M1c).
  - Reference: IASLC 8th TNM staging validation (J Thorac Oncol 2016–2017).
- Prognostic impact of PD-L1 and co-mutations:
  - PD-L1 negativity predicts poorer response to PD-1 monotherapy but is not clearly predictive for KRAS G12C inhibitor efficacy; activity is observed across PD-L1 strata (CodeBreaK 100/200; KRYSTAL-1).
  - Co-mutations:
    - STK11/LKB1 and KEAP1 are associated with inferior outcomes on immunotherapy and generally worse prognosis; in G12C inhibitor trials, efficacy is retained but outcomes may be attenuated, particularly with KEAP1 alterations. Some analyses suggest improved responses with STK11-mutant/KEAP1–wild-type subsets on sotorasib.
    - TP53 co-mutation often correlates with more inflamed biology and better ICI response; its impact on G12C inhibitor efficacy is less definitive.
  - References: Skoulidis et al. (NEJM 2018) for ICI prognostic impact of STK11/KEAP1; subgroup analyses from CodeBreaK 100 (JCO 2022) and KRYSTAL-1 presentations/publications.

2) Common progression pathways/patterns for KRAS G12C–mutant NSCLC
- Pre- and post–G12C inhibitor common sites:
  - Thoracic predominance: primary lung/contralateral lung and mediastinal/hilar nodes remain frequent progression sites.
  - Extrathoracic: liver, adrenal, bone are common; brain metastases occur in a substantial minority over the disease course.
  - Baseline incidence in KRAS-mutant cohorts includes lung/pleura and nodes most frequently, with liver/adrenal/bone each ~15–25% ranges in trial baselines; brain involvement present in a notable subset. Progression patterns tend to mirror baseline biology.
  - References: Trial baseline characteristics and subsequent progression reports from CodeBreaK 100/200 and KRYSTAL-1; observational cohorts in KRAS-mutant NSCLC.
- CNS risk and intracranial activity:
  - KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma carries a moderate risk of CNS metastases over time; vigilance is warranted.
  - Adagrasib shows prospective intracranial activity:
    - In KRYSTAL-1 CNS cohort: intracranial ORR ~32–33%, intracranial DCR ~80–86%, with intracranial PFS on the order of ~5 months; systemic OS ~11 months in this subset.
    - Reference: KRYSTAL-1 CNS cohort (J Clin Oncol 2023).
  - Sotorasib: emerging/retrospective data suggest some intracranial responses and disease control, but prospective CNS-specific efficacy data are less robust than for adagrasib.
    - References: Retrospective series and subgroup reports (e.g., J Thorac Oncol 2023; CodeBreaK program communications).
- Resistance mechanisms to KRAS G12C inhibitors (high level):
  - On-target: secondary KRAS mutations affecting the switch-II pocket (e.g., Y96, H95, R68, Q99), KRAS amplification, and alternative KRAS alleles (e.g., G13, Q61).
  - Off-target/bypass: activation of RTKs and downstream pathways (e.g., MET amplification, NRAS/HRAS/BRAF/MAP2K1 alterations), gene fusions (e.g., RET/ALK/NRG1 reported), epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and histologic shifts in rare cases.
  - References: Mechanism studies and liquid-biopsy serial analyses in KRYSTAL-1/CodeBreaK publications and translational reports (Nature Medicine 2022; JCO/Science Translational Medicine 2022–2023).

3) Literature-based qualitative prognosis framing for a patient similar to patient_4 (ECOG 1, PD-L1 negative, post–chemo-IO, starting adagrasib; M1a by contralateral nodules; no documented CNS involvement as of last record)
- Expected ranges starting at G12C inhibitor initiation:
  - Response probability: roughly 35–45%.
  - Median PFS: approximately 5–7 months.
  - Median OS: approximately 10–13 months.
- Modifiers for patient_4:
  - Favorable: M1a pattern at baseline (thoracic-only spread), ECOG 1, prior demonstrable chemo-IO sensitivity (initial PR).
  - Uncertain: Co-mutations not documented; presence of KEAP1/STK11 would tend to worsen outcomes, while absence may align with upper-range outcomes.
  - CNS: No brain imaging on record through 2021-03-27; undetected CNS disease would adversely affect prognosis, whereas CNS-negative status at start of targeted therapy would be favorable. Adagrasib has documented intracranial activity should CNS disease emerge.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Orchestrator: Thank you, everyone. Based on inputs from PatientHistory, PatientStatus, and MedicalResearch, I will now compile the requested short prognosis and progression-pathways report for patient_4. Radiology input was optional and not requested by the user, so we proceeded using the imaging reports already summarized.

Short prognosis and progression-pathways report for patient_4

Clinical snapshot
- 59-year-old female with NSCLC, adenocarcinoma favored; Stage IVA (T4 N3 M1a) at diagnosis, with M1a based on contralateral pulmonary nodules (right lung nodules on 2020-01-24 CT; 8 mm right lung base nodule on 2020-03-07 PET/CT).
- Biomarkers: KRAS p.G12C; PD-L1 negative; co-mutations (STK11/KEAP1/TP53) not documented.
- Course: Partial response to carbo/paclitaxel+pembrolizumab (mid-2020), then progression on maintenance pembrolizumab by 2021-03-22 with 4.1 cm FDG-avid left lung mass and left hilar/infrahilar nodes.
- ECOG: last documented 1 (2020-04-30). CNS imaging: none on record through 2021-03-27.

Estimated prognosis (starting at KRAS G12C inhibitor initiation, ECOG 0–1, previously treated, PD-L1 negative)
- Likelihood of response: approximately 35–45% overall response rate.
- Median progression-free survival: approximately 5–7 months.
- Median overall survival: approximately 10–13 months.
- Contextual modifiers for patient_4:
  - Favorable: M1a pattern (thoracic-limited, contralateral nodules) generally has better outcomes than M1b/M1c; ECOG 1; demonstrated initial chemo-IO sensitivity.
  - Uncertain: Co-mutation profile not available; outcomes may be lower if KEAP1 and/or STK11 are present; potentially higher if absent or if TP53 co-mutation is present.
  - CNS status unknown (no brain imaging in record); undetected brain disease would worsen prognosis; starting therapy without CNS involvement would be more favorable.

Possible progression pathways
- Thoracic-dominant progression:
  - Enlargement of primary lingular lesion and regional nodes (mediastinal/hilar), and/or new/growing pulmonary nodules, including contralateral lung.
- Extrathoracic progression:
  - Liver, adrenal, and bone are common sites; frequencies in KRAS-mutant cohorts often in the 15–25% range over the disease course.
- CNS considerations:
  - KRAS-mutant adenocarcinoma carries moderate risk of brain metastases over time. No CNS imaging is recorded through 2021-03-27; intracranial relapse can occur.
  - Adagrasib demonstrates prospective intracranial activity (intracranial ORR roughly one-third; intracranial disease control in ~80% in a CNS cohort), which may influence the pattern and management of CNS progression.
- Under KRAS G12C inhibitor pressure (adagrasib class):
  - On-target resistance (secondary KRAS mutations affecting the inhibitor-binding pocket or KRAS amplification) and off-target pathway reactivation (e.g., MET amplification, RAS/MAPK pathway alterations, fusions) are common.
  - Clinically, resistance may manifest as renewed growth in thoracic disease, new visceral lesions (liver/adrenal), or CNS progression.

Key uncertainties and watchpoints
- Most recent ECOG at or after progression not documented.
- No dedicated brain MRI/CT or brain metastasis status in record through 2021-03-27.
- Co-mutation profile (STK11/KEAP1/TP53) not available; this influences risk stratification.
- Baseline organ function and QTc prior to KRAS G12C inhibitor start are not summarized here.

Evidence basis (representative)
- Adagrasib KRYSTAL-1 (NEJM 2022; CNS cohort JCO 2023): ORR ~43%, median PFS ~6.5 months, median OS ~12.6 months; intracranial activity reported.
- Sotorasib CodeBreaK 100 (NEJM 2021; JCO 2022 update) and CodeBreaK 200 (NEJM 2023): ORR ~37%, median PFS ~6–7 months, median OS ~12–13 months; PFS benefit vs docetaxel.
- IASLC 8th TNM staging analyses (J Thorac Oncol 2016–2017): M1a generally better prognosis than M1b/M1c.
- Co-mutation impact on ICI and targeted therapy outcomes: Skoulidis et al. NEJM 2018; subgroup analyses in CodeBreaK and KRYSTAL programs.

Plan status
- PatientHistory, PatientStatus, and MedicalResearch have provided input, and Radiology was optional and not invoked.

In summary: For a patient like patient_4 (KRAS G12C+, PD-L1 negative, ECOG 1) starting a KRAS G12C inhibitor after chemo-immunotherapy, expected outcomes typically include a 35–45% response probability, median PFS around 5–7 months, and median OS around 10–13 months, with thoracic-dominant and potential CNS/visceral progression pathways. Prognosis may be moderated by the baseline M1a pattern and unknown co-mutations.

User, would you like us to:
- Involve Radiology to review the available chest X-ray image, or proceed as is?
- Have PatientHistory search for any additional NGS details or outside records that might clarify co-mutations or CNS imaging?

USER:
Orchestrator: What is the estimated prognosis for this patient based on current disease stage, treatment received, and molecular characteristics?

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Plan to answer your question:
- I will synthesize an estimated prognosis using the already-completed inputs from PatientStatus (current clinical snapshot) and MedicalResearch (evidence-based outcomes for KRAS G12C–mutated NSCLC after chemo‑IO). No new agent calls are needed. If any agent is engaged later, they will yield back with “back to you: Orchestrator.”

Estimated prognosis for patient_4 (based on current stage, treatment course, and molecular profile)
- Clinical context: Stage IVA (T4 N3 M1a by contralateral pulmonary nodules), adenocarcinoma favored; KRAS p.G12C, PD‑L1 negative; prior partial response to carboplatin/paclitaxel+pembrolizumab, with progression on maintenance pembrolizumab; last ECOG documented 1; no CNS imaging on record through 2021‑03‑27.
- Expected outcomes starting KRAS G12C inhibitor (adagrasib class), ECOG 0–1, post–chemo‑IO:
  - Response probability: approximately 35–45%.
  - Median progression‑free survival: approximately 5–7 months.
  - Median overall survival: approximately 10–13 months.
- Modifiers relevant to this case:
  - Favorable: M1a (thoracic‑limited) generally has better prognosis than M1b/M1c; ECOG 1; demonstrated initial chemo‑IO sensitivity.
  - Uncertain/variable: Co‑mutations (STK11/KEAP1/TP53) are not documented; KEAP1 and/or STK11 may shift outcomes toward the lower end, while absence of these or TP53 co‑mutation may align with the mid/upper ranges. PD‑L1 negativity does not clearly diminish G12C inhibitor efficacy. CNS status is unknown; occult brain metastases would worsen outlook, whereas CNS‑negative status at start of targeted therapy is favorable.
- Evidence basis (representative): Adagrasib KRYSTAL‑1 (NEJM 2022; intracranial cohort JCO 2023); Sotorasib CodeBreaK‑100 (NEJM 2021; JCO 2022 update) and CodeBreaK‑200 (NEJM 2023); IASLC 8th TNM analyses (J Thorac Oncol 2016–2017) for M1a vs M1b/M1c prognosis.

One‑sentence summary: In a patient like patient_4 (KRAS G12C+, PD‑L1 negative, ECOG 1) initiating a KRAS G12C inhibitor after chemo‑immunotherapy, typical cohort outcomes are a 35–45% response rate, median PFS around 5–7 months, and median OS around 10–13 months, with prognosis influenced by thoracic‑limited M1a disease (favorable), unknown co‑mutations, and unknown CNS status.

User, would you like me to have PatientHistory search for any additional NGS details or outside records (e.g., co‑mutations, brain imaging) to refine this estimate further?
