After your response, say: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n  2) PatientStatus: Summarize the current status using the details from PatientHistory (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).\\n     - Instruction to agent: PatientStatus, proceed with generating the current status summary for patient_4 using the data from PatientHistory. After your response, say: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n  3) Radiology: Review the latest imaging. If images are available from PatientHistory, analyze them; otherwise, summarize based on the provided imaging reports.\\n     - Instruction to agent: Radiology, proceed with reviewing and summarizing the latest imaging for patient_4. If images are available, analyze and report findings; if not, summarize based on the imaging reports. After your response, say: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n  4) ReportCreation: Compile a formatted Word document suitable for tumor board review, including patient timeline, clinical summary, medical history, social history, cancer type, imaging findings (CT/X-ray), pathology findings, biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, and treatment history. If treatment plan or clinical trials are not requested, include placeholders (\u201cTo be determined by tumor board\u201d).\\n     - Instruction to agent: ReportCreation, proceed with generating a Word document for patient_4 using the collected information.
