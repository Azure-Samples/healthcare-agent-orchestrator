This includes surgical pathology, cytology, IHC panels, FISH, PCR, NGS (tissue and ctDNA), and any biomarker/companion diagnostic reports, plus dates and specimen sources. Each agent, after completing their task, should yield the chat back to me (Orchestrator) by saying: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\\n- Step 2: Orchestrator will compile a concise biomarker summary indicating for each biomarker: present/absent/indeterminate, test method, date, specimen, and report reference.\\n- Optional Step 3: If you want a formatted tumor board document afterward, we can bring in ReportCreation to generate a Word document with the biomarker section included. Each agent must end with \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\\n\\nBefore we proceed, I need a couple of items from you to get PatientHistory started and make sure we search for the right markers.\\n\\nUser, can you provide:\\n1) The patient ID (so PatientHistory can locate the records)?\\n2) The list of biomarkers you want checked? If you don\u2019t have a list, you can tell me the cancer type and I can have PatientHistory pull all reported biomarkers, and we\u2019ll enumerate them for your review.\\n3) Any date range limits (e.g., only last 12 months) or include outside/archived records?\\n4) Whether you have any files to upload (PDFs/scans) that you\u2019d like included in the scan?\\n\\nNext, per our process:\\n- PatientHistory, before proceeding, confirm what information you need to retrieve and summarize all pathology and molecular testing. After confirming, say \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\\n\\nPlease confirm this plan. Once you provide the patient ID and the biomarker targets (or the cancer type), I\u2019ll cue PatientHistory to begin.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
