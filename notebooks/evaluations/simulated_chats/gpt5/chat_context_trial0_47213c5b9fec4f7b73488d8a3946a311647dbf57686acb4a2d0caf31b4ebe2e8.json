Each agent, after completing their task, will yield the chat back to me by saying: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\\n\\nPlan and order of participants:\\n1) PatientHistory: Retrieve the full record for Patient ID: patient_4, including demographics, timeline, stage at diagnosis, histology/pathology, biomarker status, treatment history, ECOG performance status, and all imaging reports plus any available imaging files.\\n- What they need: Patient ID. We have this.\\n- Action: PatientHistory, proceed with retrieving the comprehensive record for patient_4 and confirm if any data elements are missing. After responding, say \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\\n\\n2) Radiology: If actual imaging files (e.g., chest X-rays) are available from PatientHistory, analyze the latest images and provide radiology insights emphasizing the latest imaging findings suitable for tumor board. If no images are available, confirm and defer to imaging report summaries.\\n- What they need: Imaging files (e.g., chest X-ray images) or confirmation that only reports are available.\\n- Action (conditional): Radiology, please specify the image formats you can process (e.g., DICOM, JPEG/PNG) and whether you can analyze CT/MRI if provided as images. Once PatientHistory supplies imaging, analyze the latest available images and summarize key findings. After responding, say \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\\n\\n3) PatientStatus: Compile the current clinical status summary, ensuring clear entries for biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, primary site, histology, treatment history, and ECOG, using data from PatientHistory (and Radiology if available).\\n- What they need: age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG performance status.\\n- Action: PatientStatus, after PatientHistory shares the relevant fields, generate a concise current status summary. After responding, say \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\\n\\n4) ClinicalTrials (optional): If you want a trials section in the tumor board packet, we can include matches based on PatientStatus.\\n- What they need: patient status from PatientStatus, and ideally patient location and travel radius.\\n- Action (optional): ClinicalTrials, once PatientStatus is ready and if the user opts in, provide a shortlist of relevant trials. After responding, say \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\\n\\n5) ReportCreation: Assemble a formatted Word document tailored for tumor board, containing the diagnostic summary with biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, latest imaging findings, and standard sections (brief clinical summary, medical/surgical history, social history, cancer type, pathology findings, imaging findings, and\u2014if requested\u2014clinical trials).\\n- What they need: patient timeline, clinical summary/current status, medical history, social history, cancer type, CT and X-ray findings, pathology findings, treatment plan/history, and (optionally) clinical trials.\\n- Action: ReportCreation, once all inputs are compiled, generate a .docx document and provide it (for example as a downloadable file or base64-encoded). After responding, say \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\\n\\nUser, can you please confirm this plan? Additionally:\\n- Do you want us to include a ClinicalTrials section? If yes, please provide the patient\u2019s preferred trial search location (city/state/country) and travel radius.\\n- If you have any imaging files to upload (DICOM or image files), please let me know. Otherwise, we will rely on existing imaging reports from PatientHistory.\\n- Any specific formatting preferences for the tumor board document (e.g., institutional header, page size, or required sections)?\\n\\nOnce you confirm, I will proceed with step 1.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
