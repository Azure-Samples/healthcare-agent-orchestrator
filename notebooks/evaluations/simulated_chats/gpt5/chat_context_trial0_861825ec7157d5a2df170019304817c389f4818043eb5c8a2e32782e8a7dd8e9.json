I\u2019ll coordinate the following agents in this order. Important: Each agent, after completing their task, should yield the chat back to me by saying \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\\n\\n1) PatientHistory\\n- Purpose: Retrieve the comprehensive chart for patient_4: demographics, medical/surgical history, social history, oncology timeline, pathology (with histology and biomarkers), staging, treatments and responses, meds/allergies, comorbidities, ECOG, and a list of imaging studies. Include any available chest X-ray images (files/links) and CT scan findings.\\n- What they need: Patient ID (provided).\\n- Output: Structured timeline and source documents/links.\\n\\n2) PatientStatus\\n- Purpose: Create a concise, structured status summary (age, primary site, histology, biomarkers, TNM/stage, disease sites, ECOG, prior therapies with dates/responses, comorbidities, and current clinical status).\\n- What they need: Data from PatientHistory.\\n\\n3) Radiology\\n- Purpose: If chest X-ray images are available, provide radiology insights and impressions; if not, specify what\u2019s missing.\\n- What they need: Chest X-ray images (from PatientHistory or from you if you upload).\\n\\n4) ClinicalGuidelines\\n- Purpose: Provide guideline-aligned treatment options based on PatientStatus for tumor board discussion.\\n- What they need: PatientStatus.\\n\\n5) ClinicalTrials\\n- Purpose: Identify relevant clinical trials and assess fit based on key inclusion/exclusion factors.\\n- What they need: PatientStatus.\\n\\n6) ReportCreation\\n- Purpose: Generate a tumor board Word document containing timeline, clinical summary, medical and social history, cancer type, CT and X-ray findings, pathology findings, guideline-aligned options, and trial opportunities.\\n- What they need: Patient timeline, clinical summary, medical/social history, cancer type, CT/X-ray findings, pathology findings, treatment plan options (from ClinicalGuidelines), and clinical trials.\\n\\n7) MedicalResearch (optional)\\n- Purpose: Perform a targeted literature review on any specific tumor board question (e.g., biomarker-driven therapy evidence, sequencing after specific regimens).\\n- What they need: A keyword or topic you choose.\\n\\nUser, please confirm:\\n- Do you approve this plan and order?\\n- Should we include both ClinicalGuidelines and ClinicalTrials sections in the report?\\n- Do you want the optional MedicalResearch deep-dive, and if so, on what specific question or keywords?\\n\\nAdditionally:\\n- User, can you provide any imaging files for patient_4 (chest X-ray DICOM/JPEG/PNG) and any recent CT reports or pathology PDFs not already in the chart?\\n- User, do you have any special questions you want highlighted for the tumor board (e.g., resectability, systemic therapy options, trial eligibility, palliative approaches)?\\n\\nIf you confirm, I will proceed by asking:\\n- PatientHistory, proceed with retrieving the full chart for patient_4 as outlined.
