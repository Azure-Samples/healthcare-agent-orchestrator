Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Here’s the plan to prepare a complete tumor board package for Patient ID: patient_4. Each agent will perform their task in order and then yield the chat back to me. Important rule: Each agent, after completing their task, should say “back to you: Orchestrator.”

Proposed order and purpose:
1) PatientHistory
- Purpose: Retrieve the comprehensive patient timeline and all key clinical details (demographics, comorbidities, oncologic diagnosis, pathology, biomarkers, imaging reports/links, treatment history, ECOG performance status, allergies, social history).
- Input needed: Patient ID (we have: patient_4).
- Output: Structured summary including any available imaging files or report references.
- Handoff: Will say “back to you: Orchestrator.”

2) Radiology
- Purpose: Review available chest X-ray images (and provide radiology insights). If only radiology reports are available (e.g., CT), Radiology can note insights based on those reports.
- Input needed: Imaging files or links from PatientHistory (especially chest X-rays).
- Output: Key radiologic findings and comparison to prior studies if available.
- Handoff: Will say “back to you: Orchestrator.”

3) PatientStatus
- Purpose: Compile the current oncologic status.
- Input needed: age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG performance status (from PatientHistory).
- Output: Current, concise status snapshot for use by guidelines and trials.
- Handoff: Will say “back to you: Orchestrator.”

4) ClinicalGuidelines
- Purpose: Provide guideline-based treatment recommendations based on the current status.
- Input needed: PatientStatus summary.
- Output: Recommendations aligned with relevant clinical guidelines.
- Handoff: Will say “back to you: Orchestrator.”

5) ClinicalTrials
- Purpose: Identify potentially eligible clinical trials.
- Input needed: PatientStatus summary (and any site/location info if available).
- Output: List of trials with key eligibility highlights.
- Handoff: Will say “back to you: Orchestrator.”

6) ReportCreation
- Purpose: Produce a Word document suitable for tumor board review containing: patient timeline, clinical summary, medical/social history, cancer type, CT and X-ray findings, pathology findings, guideline-based treatment plan, and clinical trials.
- Input needed: Outputs from PatientHistory, Radiology, PatientStatus, ClinicalGuidelines, and ClinicalTrials.
- Output: Tumor board packet (Word document) ready for download/sharing.
- Handoff: Will say “back to you: Orchestrator.”

Optional:
7) MedicalResearch (if desired)
- Purpose: Summarize recent literature for a specific topic (e.g., biomarker-specific therapies).
- Input needed: A topic/keyword from you based on the case.
- Output: Curated summary of key studies.
- Handoff: Will say “back to you: Orchestrator.”

User, can you confirm you’d like me to proceed with this plan for patient_4? Also, please let me know:
- Any special focus areas for the tumor board (e.g., lines of therapy, surgical candidacy, radiation options, toxicity management, specific biomarkers)?
- Whether you have any imaging files (chest X-ray or CT) you want included; if yes, please upload or provide links.
- Any institutional preferences for guidelines or trial networks to prioritize.

If confirmed, I will start with PatientHistory.
