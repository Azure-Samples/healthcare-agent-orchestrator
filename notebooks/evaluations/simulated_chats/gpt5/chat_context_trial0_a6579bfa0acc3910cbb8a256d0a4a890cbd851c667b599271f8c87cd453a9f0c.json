Action: I will first ask PatientHistory what they need, then proceed once we have it. Each agent, after completing their task, should yield the chat back to me (Orchestrator) by saying: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n- Step 2: PatientStatus \u2014 Purpose: Summarize the current clinical status (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG). This allows disease-specific, evidence-based context for KRAS G12C therapy. I will first ask PatientStatus what information they need to answer, then proceed. Each agent must end with \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n- Step 3: ClinicalGuidelines \u2014 Purpose: Provide an evidence-based overview of the benefits and risks of adagrasib in the relevant disease setting (e.g., NSCLC, CRC), including when it is typically used and how guideline bodies frame its role. No treatment plan will be made here, just a summary of guidance. Each agent must end with \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n- Step 4: MedicalResearch \u2014 Purpose: Summarize key clinical trial data (e.g., response rates, progression-free survival, overall survival, intracranial activity, and adverse event profile for adagrasib), plus known drug\u2013drug interactions and precautions. Each agent must end with \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n- Optional Step 5: ClinicalTrials \u2014 Purpose: If you\u2019re interested, we can also query ongoing trials relevant to KRAS G12C and adagrasib or combinations that might be suitable in the future.

Adagrasib is included among targeted options in this post-first-line setting, alongside sotorasib. Selection between agents may consider individual patient factors, toxicity profiles, drug\u2013drug interactions, and logistical considerations. Guidelines emphasize molecular confirmation of KRAS p.G12C and appropriate clinical monitoring.\\n\\n- Potential benefits (as framed by guidelines\u2019 evidence summaries)\\n  - Tumor response and disease control: KRAS G12C inhibitors have demonstrated meaningful objective response rates and disease control in previously treated patients, offering an additional targeted line beyond chemo/immunotherapy.\\n  - Time-to-response: Responses typically occur within the first couple of cycles, which may be clinically helpful in symptomatic disease.\\n  - Intracranial activity: Adagrasib has reported activity in untreated, stable brain metastases cohorts, which is relevant when CNS involvement is present; guidelines note emerging data and encourage appropriate CNS imaging and multidisciplinary management.\\n  - Quality-of-life implications: Symptom improvement can occur with response, though formal QoL outcomes vary; toxicity management is important to maintain dose intensity where feasible.\\n\\n- Potential risks and monitoring considerations\\n  - Common toxicities: gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), fatigue, appetite decrease, and elevated liver enzymes.\\n  - Serious/clinically significant risks: hepatotoxicity (particularly with recent/ongoing immunotherapy exposure), QTc prolongation/arrhythmic risk, interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis (rare), and electrolyte abnormalities with dehydration.\\n  - Monitoring: guidelines emphasize periodic LFTs, ECG/QTc monitoring in at-risk patients or if symptoms arise, and vigilance for pulmonary symptoms suggestive of ILD/pneumonitis.\\n  - Drug\u2013drug interactions: attention to CYP3A modulators, P-gp/BCRP substrates, and other agents with QT-prolonging potential; coordination with pharmacy and cardiology when relevant.\\n  - Special populations: consider hepatic/renal function status; review comorbidities (e.g., CAD) and concomitant medications (e.g., acid-reducing agents, antiarrhythmics).\\n\\n- Prognostic context (non-directive)\\n  - In previously treated KRAS p.G12C\u2013mutated NSCLC, targeted inhibition with a KRAS G12C inhibitor can extend progression-free intervals compared with no targeted options and may improve overall outcomes for a subset of patients. Median outcomes in trials provide a benchmark (MedicalResearch will detail), but individual prognosis varies with performance status, disease burden (including CNS), co-mutations, comorbidities, and tolerability.\\n  - Guidelines recommend ongoing assessment for clinical benefit and toxicity, with imaging at appropriate intervals and supportive care optimization.\\n\\nThis overview is intended to contextualize benefits and risks without making a patient-specific treatment plan.\\n\\nback to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nOrchestrator:\\nThank you. Now I will ask MedicalResearch to summarize key clinical evidence on adagrasib relevant to this case, including response rates, PFS/OS, intracranial activity, adverse events (with frequencies/grades), and notable drug\u2013drug interactions or precautions. Please cite the trial names where possible. No patient-specific recommendations.\\n\\nMedicalResearch, proceed. End with \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d.\\n\\nMedicalResearch:\\nKey clinical evidence for adagrasib (KRAZATI) in KRAS p.G12C\u2013mutated NSCLC\\n\\n- Principal studies\\n  - KRYSTAL-1 (phase 1/2): evaluated adagrasib monotherapy in previously treated KRAS p.G12C\u2013mutated NSCLC; also included dedicated cohorts for CNS metastases.\\n  - Additional ongoing studies (e.g., KRYSTAL-12 comparing adagrasib vs docetaxel; combination trials with PD-1 inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors, SHP2 inhibitors) are expanding the evidence base.\\n\\n- Efficacy outcomes (monotherapy in previously treated NSCLC; representative ranges from peer-reviewed reports and regulatory summaries)\\n  - Objective response rate (ORR): approximately 32\u201343% across reported cohorts.\\n  - Disease control rate (DCR): approximately 70\u201380%+.\\n  - Median time to response: about 1.4\u20131.5 months.\\n  - Median duration of response (DoR): roughly 8\u20139 months (with some responses exceeding 12 months).\\n  - Median progression-free survival (PFS): approximately 6\u20137.5 months.\\n  - Median overall survival (OS): approximately 12\u201314 months in mature datasets.\\n  - Intracranial activity: in a CNS-specific cohort of patients with untreated, stable brain metastases, intracranial ORR around one-third and intracranial disease control in the majority (e.g., IC-ORR ~30\u201335%, IC-DCR ~80\u201385%); some reductions in CNS lesion size and durability have been reported.\\n\\n- Safety and tolerability\\n  - Common adverse events (any grade): nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, decreased appetite, elevated AST/ALT, anemia; many are manageable with supportive care, dose holds, or reductions.\\n  - Grade 3/4 adverse events: occur in a substantial minority (on the order of 30\u201345% across reports).\\n  - Discontinuation due to AEs: generally in the single digits to low teens percentage.\\n  - Specific risks/monitoring:\\n    - Hepatotoxicity: transaminase elevations; monitor LFTs regularly, particularly in patients recently exposed to immune checkpoint inhibitors.\\n    - QTc prolongation: ECG monitoring may be warranted, especially in patients with cardiac comorbidities, electrolyte abnormalities, or concomitant QT-prolonging drugs.\\n    - Pneumonitis/ILD: rare but serious; evaluate new/worsening respiratory symptoms promptly.\\n    - GI toxicity: prophylaxis and early management of nausea/diarrhea can help maintain adherence.\\n  - Dose modifications: Prespecified algorithms for dose interruption/reduction are used for toxicity management in trials and labeling.\\n\\n- Drug\u2013drug interactions and precautions (consult full prescribing information)\\n  - Metabolism/transport: adagrasib is affected by CYP3A; caution with strong CYP3A inhibitors/inducers; it can also affect exposures of certain substrates (e.g., P-gp/BCRP).\\n  - QTc-prolonging agents: coadministration may increase risk; consider alternatives or monitoring.\\n  - Acid-reducing agents: check label for pH-dependent absorption considerations and manage accordingly.\\n  - Hepatic/renal impairment: follow label guidance; monitor closely if baseline hepatic function is abnormal.\\n\\n- Interpreting impact on prognosis (non-directive context)\\n  - For previously treated patients with KRAS p.G12C\u2013mutated NSCLC, adagrasib provides a targeted option with a meaningful chance of tumor shrinkage and median PFS in the mid\u2013single-digit months, with some patients experiencing durable benefit. Overall survival medians around a year in trial populations provide reference but vary widely by individual factors (performance status, CNS involvement, co-mutations, and comorbidities).\\n\\nReferences include peer-reviewed publications and conference/regulatory summaries from KRYSTAL-1 and related studies.\\n\\nback to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nOrchestrator:\\nAll requested agents have provided input for this stage. Summary: In previously treated KRAS p.G12C\u2013mutated metastatic NSCLC, transitioning to adagrasib offers a targeted option with response rates around one-third to two-fifths, median PFS roughly 6\u20137 months, potential intracranial activity, and manageable but sometimes significant toxicities (notably GI, hepatic enzyme elevations, and QTc considerations), with interactions to review. Prognostic impact is variable but can be favorable for responders compared with non-targeted options.\\n\\nUser, would you like us to also query the ClinicalTrials agent for current KRAS G12C trials or combinations that could be relevant now or at future progression? If you have any updated information after 2021 (current ECOG, recent labs, brain MRI, medication list, whether adagrasib was started), we can refine the context further.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
