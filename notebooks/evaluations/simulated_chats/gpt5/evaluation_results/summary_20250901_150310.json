It engaged PatientHistory to confirm data-access parameters and later to retrieve targeted chart details (M1a basis, CNS imaging status, latest ECOG), which were the right tasks for that agent. It used PatientStatus to synthesize a concise clinical snapshot for prognosis framing\u2014an appropriate specialization. For evidence-based outcomes and progression patterns, the orchestrator routed to MedicalResearch, which provided trial-backed ranges and modifiers tailored to the patient\u2019s profile, exactly leveraging that agent\u2019s strengths. Radiology was correctly treated as optional and not invoked since no imaging files were supplied; the orchestrator explicitly checked user preference before involving it, avoiding unnecessary agent use. When the user later asked for an estimated prognosis, the orchestrator efficiently reused the already gathered inputs without calling additional agents, demonstrating judicious resource use. Although the initial plan mentioned retrieving the full record first, the orchestrator pragmatically proceeded with PatientStatus using available data and then closed gaps via PatientHistory, which did not adversely affect agent selection quality. Overall, routing for complex questions (chart details, evidence synthesis) was precise, and the orchestrator avoided superfluous agent calls while coordinating multiple agents when appropriate."

This demonstrates effective routing of sub-tasks to specialized agents and good use of multiple agents for a complex request.\n- It avoided unnecessary agents; each selected agent contributes directly to the tumor board deliverable.\n- The stepwise plan to first query each agent for their input needs is a reasonable coordination strategy that can reduce rework.\n- Missed opportunities prevent a top score:\n  - Radiology is explicitly limited to chest X-rays, while tumor boards frequently rely on cross-sectional imaging (CT/MRI/PET). Relying on CT \u201creports\u201d from PatientHistory rather than a radiology agent review of the actual CT images may limit quality. If a CT-capable radiology agent exists, it should have been selected; if not, the orchestrator could have noted the limitation or conditionalized the radiology step on available imaging.\n  - No dedicated Pathology or Genomics/Biomarker interpretation agent was engaged, despite pathology and molecular findings being central to tumor board discussions. If such agents exist, involving them would improve the plan.\n  - The plan assumes chest imaging relevance without confirming the primary cancer site; a brief conditional check after PatientHistory (e.g., only invoking Radiology if relevant imaging exists and matches tumor location) would optimize agent use.\n\nOverall, the orchestrator\u2019s agent selection is strong and well-structured, with minor mismatches and missed specialization that keep it from being \u201cexcellent.\u201d"
