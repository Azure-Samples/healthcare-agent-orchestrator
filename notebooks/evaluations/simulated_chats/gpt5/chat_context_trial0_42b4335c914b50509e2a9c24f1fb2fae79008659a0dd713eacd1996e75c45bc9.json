I\u2019ll coordinate the following agents in this order, and each agent will hand control back to me by saying \u201cback to you: Orchestrator\u201d after their response:\\n\\n1) PatientHistory\\n- Purpose: Retrieve the comprehensive patient record, including demographics, medical and social history, cancer type, staging at diagnosis, pathology and biomarker results, ECOG performance status, treatment history, and all imaging reports/assets (CT, X-ray, etc.).\\n- Next step: I will first ask PatientHistory what they need to proceed, then provide Patient ID: patient_4.\\n\\n2) Radiology\\n- Purpose: Review the latest available imaging. If actual images (e.g., DICOM or image files) are present, Radiology will analyze them; otherwise, they will synthesize key findings from the official radiology reports and clearly note the source and date.\\n- Input needed: Imaging files or, if unavailable, the official imaging report(s) from PatientHistory.\\n\\n3) PatientStatus\\n- Purpose: Compile the current clinical status (age, primary site, histology, biomarkers, stage at diagnosis and current stage if different, treatment history summary, ECOG performance status).\\n- Input needed: Data collected by PatientHistory (and Radiology\u2019s summary for the latest imaging component).\\n\\n4) ClinicalTrials\\n- Purpose: Identify potentially relevant clinical trials based on the compiled patient status (optional but commonly included for tumor board packets; no treatment recommendations will be made).\\n- Input needed: PatientStatus output.\\n\\n5) ReportCreation\\n- Purpose: Produce a formatted Word document suitable for a tumor board, including patient timeline, clinical summary, medical and social history, cancer type, pathology findings (including biomarkers), stage at diagnosis, treatment history, latest imaging findings, and a ClinicalTrials section if included.\\n- Output: A downloadable Word document.\\n\\nUser, can you please confirm:\\n- Should I include a ClinicalTrials section in the report? (Yes/No)\\n- Do you have any additional imaging files to upload, or should we use whatever is already in the record for patient_4?\\n\\nIf you confirm, I will proceed as above. Once confirmed, I will start by asking PatientHistory what they need, then supply Patient ID: patient_4 and continue through the steps.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
