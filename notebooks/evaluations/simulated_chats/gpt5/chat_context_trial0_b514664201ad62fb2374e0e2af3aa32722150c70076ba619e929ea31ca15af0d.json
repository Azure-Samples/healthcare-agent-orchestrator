Each agent, after completing their task, should yield the chat back to me (Orchestrator) by saying: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\\n\\nPlanned order and purpose:\\n1) PatientHistory: Confirm and retrieve the record for patient_4 and extract key clinical details (timeline, primary site, histology, stage, biomarkers like PD-L1 and co-mutations, prior treatments, ECOG).\\n- First, I will ask PatientHistory what information they need to proceed.\\n2) PatientStatus: Summarize the current clinical status from PatientHistory (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers including KRAS p.G12C, prior therapies, ECOG). This will frame the context for evidence-based options.\\n3) ClinicalGuidelines: Provide a non-prescriptive, guideline-based summary of current treatment options relevant to KRAS p.G12C (e.g., KRAS inhibitors, chemo-immunotherapy sequences), including efficacy and risk profile, without making a patient-specific treatment plan.\\n4) ClinicalTrials: Summarize emerging trial drugs and combinations for KRAS p.G12C, with brief efficacy signals and safety considerations, filtered to the patient\u2019s status if possible.\\n\\nUser, please confirm this plan so I can proceed. Also, to ensure we tailor the summary appropriately, if PatientHistory does not have a record for patient_4, could you provide the patient\u2019s age, primary cancer type, stage, histology, PD-L1 status, notable co-mutations (e.g., STK11, KEAP1, TP53), prior treatments and responses, and ECOG performance status?\\n\\nIf you confirm, I will begin:\\n\\n- PatientHistory, before proceeding, what information do you need to retrieve details for this case? After your response, say \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
