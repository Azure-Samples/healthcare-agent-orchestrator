USER:
Analyze the latest CT and CXR images for patient_4 using the imaging tool, compare AI-generated findings to the radiologistâ€™s report, and summarize any discrepancies or additional findings.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Here’s the plan and workflow I propose to fulfill your request. Each agent will respond in sequence and then yield the chat back to me. After each completes their task, they will say “back to you: Orchestrator.”

Purpose and order:
1) PatientHistory: Retrieve the latest CT and CXR studies for patient_4, including the actual images (or links/paths), acquisition dates, exam types (e.g., CT chest with/without contrast), and the official radiologist reports for those exams. PatientHistory will also confirm if prior comparison studies exist.
2) Radiology: Use the imaging tool to analyze the provided images (CXR, and CT if supported), generate AI findings, then compare those to the radiologist reports to highlight discrepancies or additional findings. Before analyzing, I will ask Radiology to specify exactly what they need (e.g., image format, series info, contrast phase) so we provide it correctly.

Important rule: Each agent, after completing their task, should yield the chat back to me (Orchestrator) by saying “back to you: Orchestrator.”

User, please confirm if you’d like me to proceed with this plan for patient_4. If confirmed, I will start by requesting the imaging and reports from PatientHistory, then coordinate with Radiology for analysis and comparison.
