I will coordinate the following agents in this order. Each agent, after completing their task, should yield the chat back to me (Orchestrator) by saying: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n\\nPlanned order and purpose:\\n1) PatientHistory\\n- Purpose: Retrieve the complete patient timeline, medical history, social history, prior and current treatments, cancer type and staging, pathology findings, and available imaging reports and files (e.g., chest X-rays, CT reports).\\n- Process: \\n  a) Orchestrator will first ask PatientHistory what information they need to proceed.\\n  b) Then I will provide the Patient ID (patient_4) to obtain the data.\\n- Expected output: Timeline, clinical summary, medical/social history, imaging reports/files, pathology details, treatment history/current plan (if any).\\n\\n2) Radiology\\n- Purpose: Provide radiology insights on available chest X-ray images. We will use CT scan findings from the reports provided by PatientHistory (as Radiology focuses on chest X-rays).\\n- Process:\\n  a) Orchestrator will first ask Radiology what information they need to proceed.\\n  b) Then I will supply the chest X-ray images (from PatientHistory) for analysis.\\n- Expected output: X-ray findings and interpretation.\\n\\n3) PatientStatus\\n- Purpose: Summarize current patient status.\\n- Process:\\n  a) Orchestrator will first ask PatientStatus what information they need.\\n  b) Then I will supply age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, and ECOG performance status (sourced from PatientHistory).\\n- Expected output: A concise, structured patient status summary.\\n\\n4) ClinicalTrials\\n- Purpose: Identify potentially relevant clinical trials based on the patient\u2019s status (informational only).\\n- Process:\\n  a) Orchestrator will first ask ClinicalTrials what they need.\\n  b) Then I will provide the PatientStatus summary.\\n- Expected output: List of trials with brief descriptions, key eligibility highlights, and locations.\\n\\n5) ReportCreation\\n- Purpose: Generate a Word document suitable for tumor board review.\\n- Process:\\n  a) Orchestrator will first ask ReportCreation what inputs they need.\\n  b) Then I will provide: patient timeline, clinical summary, medical history, social history, cancer type, CT scan findings (from PatientHistory\u2019s reports), X-ray findings (from Radiology), pathology findings, current treatment plan if documented (from PatientHistory), and clinical trials (from ClinicalTrials).\\n- Expected output: A formatted Word document for tumor board.\\n\\nUser, please confirm that you\u2019d like me to proceed with this plan for Patient ID: patient_4. Once confirmed, I will begin by asking PatientHistory what they need and proceed step-by-step.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
