Each agent, after completing their task, should yield the chat back to me (Orchestrator) by saying: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\\n\\nPlan:\\n1) PatientHistory: Retrieve, for patient_4, the latest CT and chest X-ray (CXR) image files along with their acquisition dates and the finalized radiologist reports. If multiple CT series exist (e.g., chest vs. CAP), please include the most recent chest-focused CT and specify the series. \\n2) Radiology: Use the imaging tool to analyze the provided CT and CXR images. Then compare the AI-generated findings against the radiologist\u2019s report, highlighting any discrepancies or additional findings.\\n\\nBefore we proceed, Radiology, please confirm what you need in order to analyze CT in addition to CXR. Do you require DICOM files, or are high-resolution image exports acceptable? Also confirm any preferred formats or metadata (e.g., series descriptions, slice thickness).\\n\\nUser, can you confirm this plan so I can proceed? If confirmed, I will first ask PatientHistory to pull the latest CT and CXR images and the corresponding radiology reports for patient_4.\\n\\nIf you confirm:\\n- PatientHistory, proceed with: For patient_4, provide the latest CT (preferably chest-focused) and the latest chest X-ray images, their acquisition dates, and the finalized radiologist reports for both. Include links or attachments to the actual image files (DICOM preferred) and identify the report timestamps. Then say: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\\n- Radiology, once PatientHistory provides the data, proceed with: Analyze both studies using the imaging tool, list objective AI findings per modality, compare them to the radiologist\u2019s impressions, and summarize discrepancies and any additional findings. Then say: \u201cback to you: Orchestrator.\u201d\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
