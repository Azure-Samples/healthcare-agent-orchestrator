PatientHistory \u2014 validate the patient ID, retrieve/scan the provided pathology and molecular reports, and produce a structured patient_timeline plus a concise history_summary that lists detected biomarkers and their values. PatientHistory: after you finish, yield back with \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n2. MedicalResearch \u2014 if we need clarification about biomarker definitions, variants, or assay interpretation (not clinical recommendations), MedicalResearch will provide supporting information. MedicalResearch: after you finish, yield back with \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n3. (Optional) PatientStatus \u2014 if you\u2019d like an assembled current status using the extracted biomarkers and other clinical info, PatientStatus can compile that. PatientStatus: after you finish, yield back with \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n\\nSpecial rule (must follow)\\n- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator) and conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nWhat I need from you now\\nUser, please provide:\\n1) The patient ID as a string (required). Example: \\\"PAT12345\\\"\\n2) The pathology and molecular testing reports to scan \u2014 either as uploaded files (PDF, images) or pasted text. If you have many documents, group them or indicate order.\\n3) A list of biomarkers you want us to look for (examples: EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, KRAS, HER2, NTRK, PD-L1, MSI, TMB, RET). If you want us to scan for all reported biomarkers, say \\\"scan all\\\".\\n4) Any format preference for the output (JSON for machine parsing, or human-readable summary).\\n\\nPatientHistory, please confirm what you specifically require beyond the above (file types, naming conventions) to validate the patient ID and extract pathology/molecular findings, and confirm readiness to proceed once the user supplies the inputs. PatientHistory: after you finish, yield back with \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n\\nMicro-update after inputs are provided: I will summarize what was uploaded and then assign PatientHistory to extract the biomarker data.
