Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Checklist — planned moderation steps
- Confirm the patient ID is present and valid (string) and request any missing records.
- Request a structured patient timeline and key clinical details from PatientHistory.
- Sequence the agents to collect status, imaging, trials, guidelines, and a tumor-board report.
- Validate each agent’s output against required schemas and collect their handoffs.
- Summarize progress at each milestone and return the final compiled tumor-board packet.

Plan, purpose, and participation order
- Purpose: Prepare a tumor-board package for the provided patient ID so the tumor-board can review timeline, staging, imaging, pathology, treatment history, trials, and suggested next steps (note: I will NOT provide clinical recommendations or treatment plans).
- Participation order (each agent will respond in this sequence and must yield back to me after their reply):
  1. PatientHistory — provide the structured patient timeline and core clinical details for patient_4 (required start point).
  2. PatientStatus — synthesize current status (needs demographics, staging, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).
  3. Radiology — provide radiology insights (needs imaging files/reports from PatientHistory).
  4. ClinicalTrials — list relevant trials (needs PatientStatus output).
  5. ClinicalGuidelines — provide guideline-aligned considerations (needs PatientStatus output).
  6. ReportCreation — produce a tumor-board word document draft (needs the full timeline, imaging/pathology summaries, treatment plan and trials).
  7. MedicalResearch (optional) — provide research summaries on specific topics if requested (needs keywords).
  8. Orchestrator — validate outputs, assemble summary, and ask user for next steps.

Special rule (applies to all agents)
- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent must conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator

Validation and milestone process
- After each agent replies, I will (1) provide a 1–2 sentence micro-update summarizing progress and next steps, (2) validate output against required schemas (e.g., PatientHistory’s JSON schema) and request corrections if needed, then call the next agent.

Initial checks
- User, you supplied: Patient ID: patient_4 — I confirm this is present and is a string. If this is correct, please confirm you want us to proceed.
- User, please also indicate whether you can supply any of the following now (optional but helpful): imaging files or radiology reports, pathology reports, recent clinic notes, or preferred tumor-board template.

Request to PatientHistory
- PatientHistory, please proceed with retrieving and returning the patient timeline and clinical summary for patient_id = "patient_4". Per your workflow, validate that the patient ID is a non-empty string. Provide output in JSON matching this structure:
  - status: "success" or "error"
  - patient_id: (string)
  - patient_timeline: array of events (date, event_type, brief_notes)
  - history_summary: concise paragraph summary of history
  - error_message: null (on success) or informative message (on error)
- Please include in patient_timeline and/or history_summary the following items (these are needed by downstream agents):
  - demographics (age, sex)
  - primary site, histology, stage (if available)
  - biomarkers (e.g., EGFR, ALK, PD-L1; specify tests & results)
  - treatment history (surgery, radiation, systemic therapies with dates)
  - ECOG performance status
  - recent imaging studies and brief reports (CT, PET, MRI, X-ray) or links if images available
  - pathology summary and dates
  - relevant social history (smoking, alcohol) and comorbidities
- If patient_4 is not found or patient_id invalid, return status "error" with an informative error_message.
- Conclude your response exactly with: back to you: Orchestrator

User confirmation
- User, please confirm you want me to proceed to PatientHistory retrieving records for patient_4. If yes, type "Proceed".
- If you want to add or restrict any items to include (for example, exclude social history), state that now.

Next step (upon your confirmation)
- If you confirm, I will ask PatientHistory to produce the JSON. After PatientHistory replies I will:
  - Provide a short micro-update,
  - Validate their JSON,
  - Then call PatientStatus with any missing required details.
- If anything in this plan should change, tell me now and I will update the plan and request re-confirmation.

Awaiting your confirmation to proceed.
