PatientStatus will then synthesize current clinical status from that timeline. Then MedicalResearch will provide efficacy/safety evidence on adagrasib. ClinicalGuidelines can comment on guideline-context considerations (but will not give clinical recommendations). ClinicalTrials can list relevant trials. Optionally, ReportCreation can prepare a tumor-board document.\\n3) If general (no patient ID), I can immediately call MedicalResearch and ClinicalTrials to summarize benefits, risks, and potential prognostic impacts in general terms; PatientStatus/PatientHistory/ClinicalGuidelines would not be able to tailor without patient data.\\n\\nImportant rule to note (applies to all agents)\\n- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent will conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nNext, I need you to choose one of the following so we can proceed\\n- Option A \u2014 Patient-specific assessment: Please provide the patient ID as a string (required for PatientHistory). If you do not have a patient ID, you may instead provide the following key details directly: age, cancer primary site, stage, histology, prior treatments (names/dates), biomarkers (including KRAS p.G12C confirmation, PD-L1, EGFR, ALK, etc.), current ECOG performance status, and any relevant organ-function labs.\\n- Option B \u2014 General literature summary: indicate you want a general summary (no patient ID needed). I will then engage MedicalResearch and ClinicalTrials for efficacy/safety and prognostic context.\\n\\nUser, please reply with:\\n- Your choice (Option A or B).\\n- If Option A: provide the patient ID as a string (required) OR the key clinical details listed above.\\n\\nPatientHistory, please stand by \u2014 once the user provides a patient ID string you may proceed to validate it and retrieve the timeline following your workflow. PatientStatus, ClinicalGuidelines, MedicalResearch, and ClinicalTrials: remain ready; I will call each in order after receiving the user\u2019s choice and any required inputs.\\n\\nMicro-update protocol\\n- After each agent responds, I will give a 1\u20132 sentence micro-update summarizing progress and the next step.\\n\\nPlease confirm how you\u2019d like to proceed.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
