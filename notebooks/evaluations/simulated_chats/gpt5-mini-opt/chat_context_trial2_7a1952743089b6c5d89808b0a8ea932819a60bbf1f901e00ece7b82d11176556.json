PatientHistory: retrieve and return a validated, structured patient timeline and all relevant EMR provider notes and AI-generated outputs for patient_4 (imaging reports, pathology reports, biomarker reports). Deliver in the required JSON schema.\\n2. Radiology: only if PatientHistory supplies images or imaging files \u2014 analyze image(s) and/or imaging reports for potential discrepancies.\\n3. PatientStatus: synthesize current clinical status from the retrieved timeline (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG) to help detect mismatches.\\n4.
