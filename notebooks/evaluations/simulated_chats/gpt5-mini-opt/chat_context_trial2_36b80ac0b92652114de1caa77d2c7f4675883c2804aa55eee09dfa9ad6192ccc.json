PatientHistory \u2014 provide the structured patient timeline and core clinical details for patient_4 (required start point).\\n  2. PatientStatus \u2014 synthesize current status (needs demographics, staging, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).\\n  3. Radiology \u2014 provide radiology insights (needs imaging files/reports from PatientHistory).\\n  4. ClinicalTrials \u2014 list relevant trials (needs PatientStatus output).\\n  5. ClinicalGuidelines \u2014 provide guideline-aligned considerations (needs PatientStatus output).\\n  6. ReportCreation \u2014 produce a tumor-board word document draft (needs the full timeline, imaging/pathology summaries, treatment plan and trials).\\n  7. MedicalResearch (optional) \u2014 provide research summaries on specific topics if requested (needs keywords).\\n  8. Orchestrator \u2014 validate outputs, assemble summary, and ask user for next steps.\\n\\nSpecial rule (applies to all agents)\\n- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent must conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nValidation and milestone process\\n- After each agent replies, I will (1) provide a 1\u20132 sentence micro-update summarizing progress and next steps, (2) validate output against required schemas (e.g., PatientHistory\u2019s JSON schema) and request corrections if needed, then call the next agent.\\n\\nInitial checks\\n- User, you supplied: Patient ID: patient_4 \u2014 I confirm this is present and is a string. If this is correct, please confirm you want us to proceed.\\n- User, please also indicate whether you can supply any of the following now (optional but helpful): imaging files or radiology reports, pathology reports, recent clinic notes, or preferred tumor-board template.\\n\\nRequest to PatientHistory\\n- PatientHistory, please proceed with retrieving and returning the patient timeline and clinical summary for patient_id = \\\"patient_4\\\". Per your workflow, validate that the patient ID is a non-empty string. Provide output in JSON matching this structure:\\n  - status: \\\"success\\\" or \\\"error\\\"\\n  - patient_id: (string)\\n  - patient_timeline: array of events (date, event_type, brief_notes)\\n  - history_summary: concise paragraph summary of history\\n  - error_message: null (on success) or informative message (on error)\\n- Please include in patient_timeline and/or history_summary the following items (these are needed by downstream agents):\\n  - demographics (age, sex)\\n  - primary site, histology, stage (if available)\\n  - biomarkers (e.g., EGFR, ALK, PD-L1; specify tests & results)\\n  - treatment history (surgery, radiation, systemic therapies with dates)\\n  - ECOG performance status\\n  - recent imaging studies and brief reports (CT, PET, MRI, X-ray) or links if images available\\n  - pathology summary and dates\\n  - relevant social history (smoking, alcohol) and comorbidities\\n- If patient_4 is not found or patient_id invalid, return status \\\"error\\\" with an informative error_message.\\n- Conclude your response exactly with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nUser confirmation\\n- User, please confirm you want me to proceed to PatientHistory retrieving records for patient_4. If yes, type \\\"Proceed\\\".\\n- If you want to add or restrict any items to include (for example, exclude social history), state that now.\\n\\nNext step (upon your confirmation)\\n- If you confirm, I will ask PatientHistory to produce the JSON. After PatientHistory replies I will:\\n  - Provide a short micro-update,\\n  - Validate their JSON,\\n  - Then call PatientStatus with any missing required details.\\n- If anything in this plan should change, tell me now and I will update the plan and request re-confirmation.\\n\\nAwaiting your confirmation to proceed.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
