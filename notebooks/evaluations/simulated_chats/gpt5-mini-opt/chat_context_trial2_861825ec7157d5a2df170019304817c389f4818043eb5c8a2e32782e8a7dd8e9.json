PatientHistory \u2014 retrieve patient timeline and core clinical data for patient_4.\\n  2. Radiology \u2014 review imaging (needs images or links; can accept imaging provided by PatientHistory).\\n  3. PatientStatus \u2014 synthesize current status (needs age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).\\n  4. ClinicalTrials \u2014 identify relevant trials (needs patient status from PatientStatus).\\n  5. ClinicalGuidelines \u2014 summarize guideline-based options (needs patient status from PatientStatus).\\n  6. MedicalResearch (optional) \u2014 provide research context or recent studies (needs keywords/topic).\\n  7. ReportCreation \u2014 compile a Word document for tumor board (needs timeline, summaries, imaging/path, trial options).\\n- Special rule to include here explicitly:\\n  Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent must conclude their response with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nValidation of input\\n- I confirm you provided a patient ID and it is a string: \\\"patient_4\\\" \u2014 valid. We may proceed.\\n\\nRequests before I start\\n- PatientHistory, please proceed with retrieving the timeline for patient_id \\\"patient_4\\\". What specific details do you need from the user or records to complete the timeline retrieval? (PatientHistory: remember to validate that patient ID is present and a string; conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator)\\n- User, please provide any of the following if available (addressing you directly):\\n  - Imaging files or links (CT chest/abdomen/pelvis, PET-CT, chest x-ray) and dates.\\n  - Pathology report(s) including histology and molecular markers.\\n  - Current staging, ECOG performance status, age.\\n  - Complete treatment history (surgery, chemo, radiation, systemic agents and dates).\\n  - Any relevant labs or clinical notes.\\n  - If you do not have these, tell us which items are unavailable.\\n\\nMicro-update and confirmation request\\n- After PatientHistory responds, I will give a 1\u20132 sentence micro-update and then call Radiology (if images are available) or PatientStatus next.\\n- Please confirm you agree with this plan and provide the items requested (or say \\\"proceed\\\" if you want us to fetch only the data PatientHistory can access).\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
