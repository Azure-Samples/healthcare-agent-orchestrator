PatientHistory \u2014 validate patient_id and return structured timeline + core data (age, primary site, histology, staging, biomarkers incl. KRAS, treatment history, ECOG, and geographic location if available).\\n2. PatientStatus \u2014 synthesize current patient status from the PatientHistory output.\\n3. ClinicalTrials \u2014 list active trials matching the synthesized patient status and geographic constraints (trial phase + contact info).\\nSpecial rule (applies to every agent)\\n- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator) and conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nNext actions and questions\\n- *PatientHistory*, please proceed: validate that patient_id is provided and is a string (\\\"patient_4\\\") and retrieve the patient_timeline and the specific data elements listed above. Follow your workflow: for success, return JSON with status \\\"success\\\", patient_id, patient_timeline (array of events), concise history_summary, and error_message null. If the ID is missing/invalid, return status \\\"error\\\" with an informative error_message. Conclude with \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n- User, before we proceed: can you confirm that \\\"patient_4\\\" is the correct patient ID and provide the patient\u2019s geographic location (city, state/province, country or ZIP/postal code)? Also tell us whether the patient is willing to travel for a trial (yes/no and max travel distance or region). If geographic location is already in the record, say \\\"location in chart\\\".\\n- If there are any constraints we should know for trial eligibility (e.g., age limits, comorbidities, ability to travel, insurance/public-payer restrictions), please state them now.\\n\\nPlease confirm the plan and provide the requested location details.
