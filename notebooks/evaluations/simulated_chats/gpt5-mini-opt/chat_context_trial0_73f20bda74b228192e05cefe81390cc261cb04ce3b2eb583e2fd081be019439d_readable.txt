USER:
Can you scan all pathology and molecular testing to see if these biomarkers are present

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Checklist — my planned moderation steps
- Confirm required inputs (patient ID string and pathology/molecular report files or EHR access).
- Assign tasks and order of agent participation to retrieve and analyze reports.
- Request any missing details from the user and from PatientHistory before work begins.
- Coordinate the agents’ analyses (biomarker extraction, relevance lookup, optional report creation).
- Return stepwise updates after each agent finishes and ensure each agent yields control back.

Planned process and participant order
1) PatientHistory — validate patient ID and retrieve or accept uploaded pathology and molecular testing reports. (Required first step.)
2) MedicalResearch — scan the provided pathology/molecular reports and extract/identify reported biomarkers (mutation calls, fusions, expression results like PD-L1, MSI/TMB status, copy-number changes).
3) ClinicalTrials (optional) — if you want, list trials relevant to identified biomarkers (requires PatientStatus output).
4) ReportCreation (optional) — if you want a tumor-board style Word summary of findings.

Special rule (applies to every agent)
- Each agent, after completing their task, must conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator

What I need from you now, User
- Please provide the patient ID as a string (required). Example: "patient_12345".
- Upload the pathology and molecular testing reports (PDFs, images or text). If the reports are in an EHR and you want PatientHistory to fetch them, please confirm access and note where they are stored.
- Tell me whether you want me to scan for all reported biomarkers or focus on specific ones (examples: EGFR, ALK, ROS1, KRAS, BRAF, RET, NTRK, HER2, PD-L1, MSI, TMB). If you don’t specify, I will look for all biomarkers reported in the documents.
- Confirm you consent to parsing these documents for the purpose of extracting biomarker information.

User prompt (please respond)
- User, can you provide the patient ID as a string and upload the pathology/molecular testing reports (or confirm EHR access)? Also tell me whether to search for all biomarkers or only specific ones from the list above.

Agent prompt
- PatientHistory, please confirm you can proceed once the user provides a patient ID string and any uploaded reports. Indicate any additional requirements you need to produce a structured patient_timeline and history_summary (per your workflow). Then wait for the user input. back to you: Orchestrator

Next step after your response
- Once the user supplies the patient ID and reports (and confirms scope), I will direct PatientHistory to validate and retrieve the documents. After that, I will instruct MedicalResearch to extract and list the biomarkers found and provide a concise summary. I will give a 1–2 sentence micro-update after each agent completes their step.

Please confirm or provide the requested items so we can begin.
