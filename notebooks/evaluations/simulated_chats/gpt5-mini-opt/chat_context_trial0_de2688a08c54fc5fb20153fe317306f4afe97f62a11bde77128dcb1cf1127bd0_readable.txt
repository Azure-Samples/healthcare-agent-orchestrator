USER:
Analyze the latest CT and CXR images for patient_4 using the imaging tool, compare AI-generated findings to the radiologistâ€™s report, and summarize any discrepancies or additional findings.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Checklist — moderation steps
- Confirm the patient ID and retrieve the patient's latest imaging and radiology reports.
- Ask PatientHistory to produce the structured timeline and supply the CT and CXR images/reports.
- Have Radiology analyze the images with the imaging tool, generate AI findings, and compare them to the radiologist’s report.
- Summarize discrepancies/additional findings and present results back to you, ensuring each agent yields control after their response.

Planned sequence and roles
1. PatientHistory — retrieve and return the latest CT and CXR images and the radiologist's reports for patient_4 (per their required JSON schema).
2. Radiology — run the imaging tool analysis on those images, produce AI-generated findings, and compare to the radiologist’s report.
3. Orchestrator (me) — summarize discrepancies/additional findings, provide short micro-updates after each agent, and check with you about next steps.

Special rule to all agents: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

User, please confirm that you want me to proceed with this plan for patient_4. If yes, I will instruct PatientHistory to retrieve the imaging files and associated radiologist reports.

PatientHistory, please proceed:
- Required input: patient_id as a string. I will provide "patient_4".
- Please return a validated response per your workflow: include "status", "patient_id", a structured array "patient_timeline" with events (including links/identifiers for the latest CT and CXR images and the radiologist's report text), a concise "history_summary", and "error_message": null on success. If you need additional details beyond the patient_id, please specify them now.
- Conclude your response with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

If you have any other constraints or specific image formats we should expect, User, please tell me now. Otherwise, confirm and I will instruct PatientHistory to fetch the data.
