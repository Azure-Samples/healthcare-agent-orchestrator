USER:
Generate a comprehensive diagnostic summary for Patient ID: patient_4 including biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, and latest imaging findings. Export the report as a formatted Word document for tumor board presentation.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation checklist
- Confirm and validate the provided patient ID and any missing data needed.
- Request the patient timeline and structured history from PatientHistory.
- Use PatientHistory output to request patient status (PatientStatus) and imaging interpretation (Radiology).
- Instruct ReportCreation to generate the Word tumor-board report once all clinical pieces are collected.
- Return collected outputs to you and deliver the Word document; request confirmation for next steps.

Planned sequence and roles
1. PatientHistory (validate patient_id, retrieve patient timeline, biomarkers, pathology, treatment history, imaging reports).  
2. PatientStatus (summarize current status: age, stage, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).  
3. Radiology (interpret latest imaging — needs images or the imaging report from PatientHistory).  
4. ReportCreation (assemble a formatted Word tumor-board document — needs timeline, summaries, imaging and pathology findings).  

Special rule to all agents: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent must conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

User — quick confirmations and any additional inputs needed
- User, please confirm that the correct patient ID is exactly: "patient_4".
- User, do you have any of the following to upload or paste now? If yes, please provide:
  - Latest imaging files (CT/PET/CT, chest x-ray) or the radiology report text
  - Pathology report(s) (including biomarker testing results)
  - Any treatment notes or medication list not already in the chart
  - Date of most recent clinic visit or scan
If you cannot provide additional files, I will proceed requesting the patient record from PatientHistory for the data available in the record.

PatientHistory — please proceed
- PatientHistory, please validate the provided patient_id = "patient_4" (confirm it's present and a string). If invalid, return an error per your schema.
- If valid, retrieve and return a structured response according to your workflow:
  - status: "success"
  - patient_id
  - patient_timeline: an array of events (dates, event type: diagnosis, staging, path report, biomarker results, treatments with dates/doses, imaging reports/findings)
  - history_summary: concise summary (1–3 sentences) of key points: cancer type, stage at diagnosis, biomarker summary, major treatments, latest imaging date/findings
  - error_message: null
- If patient_id missing/invalid, return status "error" and an informative error_message.
- After your response, conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

Next steps after PatientHistory responds
- I will provide a 1–2 sentence micro-update and then instruct PatientStatus (and Radiology if needed) to proceed using the data you return.
- Once PatientStatus and Radiology respond, I will instruct ReportCreation to produce the Word document for tumor board presentation.

Please confirm you agree with this plan, User. If yes, PatientHistory should proceed as requested.
