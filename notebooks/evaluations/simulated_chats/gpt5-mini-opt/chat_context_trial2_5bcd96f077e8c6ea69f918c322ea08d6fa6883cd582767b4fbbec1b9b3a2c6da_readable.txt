USER:
Generate a comprehensive diagnostic summary for Patient ID: patient_4 including biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, and latest imaging findings. Export the report as a formatted Word document for tumor board presentation.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Checklist — planned moderation steps
- Validate the provided patient ID and retrieve the patient's timeline and clinical data.
- Use PatientHistory output to populate PatientStatus (for current status) and to identify imaging/pathology that Radiology and ReportCreation will need.
- Request any missing items from the user (images, pathology reports, formatting preferences).
- Coordinate Radiology, PatientStatus, ClinicalTrials (if requested), and ReportCreation in order, collecting each agent's output and returning to the user for confirmation.
- Produce the tumor-board Word report via ReportCreation once all inputs are collected and confirmed.

Planned sequence and participation order
1. PatientHistory — retrieve and summarize the patient's timeline, biomarkers, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, latest imaging reports (and provide structured JSON per spec).
2. PatientStatus — derive current status (requires PatientHistory outputs: age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).
3. Radiology — analyze images or imaging reports (needs images or imaging reports from PatientHistory or from the user).
4. ClinicalTrials (optional) — identify potential trials based on PatientStatus if you request this.
5. ReportCreation — assemble a formatted Word document for tumor board using the collected timeline, clinical summary, imaging/pathology findings, and treatment history.
Each agent, after completing their task, must yield chat back to me (the Orchestrator) and conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

Immediate actions now
- PatientHistory, please proceed:
  - Validate that the patient ID is present and a string (patient_4).
  - Retrieve relevant patient timeline data and include: age, date of diagnosis, primary site, histology, stage at diagnosis, biomarker status (e.g., EGFR, ALK, PD-L1, others), ECOG performance status (if documented), full treatment history (dates, regimens, responses), and latest imaging reports/findings (CT, PET, X-ray text if available).
  - Return a JSON object per your workflow: status ("success" or "error"), patient_id, patient_timeline (array of events with dates and brief details), history_summary (concise), and error_message (null if success).
  - If imaging files are referenced but not available as images, include the imaging report text and indicate images are missing.
  - Conclude your message with: back to you: Orchestrator

User, I need a couple quick clarifications before we begin:
- Do you confirm the patient ID is patient_4? (If yes, I will ask PatientHistory to proceed.) 
- Do you have any image files (CT, PET, chest x-ray) or pathology reports to upload now? Radiology can analyze images but needs the image files; if you don't have images, textual imaging reports are sufficient.
- Any formatting preferences for the Word tumor-board report? (e.g., institutional header, include imaging figures inline, anonymize patient identifiers, margin/page limits)

Please confirm the above and upload any files now if available. Once PatientHistory returns their structured output, I will instruct PatientStatus and Radiology on what they need to produce next.

Micro-update: after PatientHistory responds, I will summarize the retrieved data and then request any missing items required by Radiology or ReportCreation.
