PatientHistory: validate the patient ID and retrieve the latest CT and CXR study metadata, attached images (if stored), and the radiologist\u2019s reports for patient_4.\\n2. User: if PatientHistory cannot provide images/reports from the record, you will upload the CT and CXR images (DICOM preferred) and the radiologist\u2019s reports.\\n3. Radiology: perform AI-based imaging analysis on the provided CT and CXR, compare AI findings to the radiologist\u2019s report, and list any discrepancies or additional findings.\\n4. Orchestrator (me): summarize results, provide a concise comparison and next steps for any missing inputs.\\n\\nSpecial rule to be followed by all agents\\n- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator) and conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nImmediate requests and inputs needed now\\n- PatientHistory, please proceed with retrieving patient_4\u2019s timeline and the latest CT chest and chest X\u2011ray study records, including any attached image files (DICOM/PNG) and the radiologist\u2019s report texts. Validate that the provided patient ID is a non-empty string. After you retrieve these, report: study dates, modalities, and whether images and reports are available. Conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\n- Radiology, before you begin analysis: please list precisely what image formats and report formats you require (e.g., CT DICOM series, CXR AP/PA + lateral DICOMs, radiologist report text or PDF) and any preferred study date/time to analyze. Conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\n- User, can you confirm the patient ID is \\\"patient_4\\\" and either:\\n  1) Confirm that the latest CT and CXR images and the radiologist\u2019s reports are available in the record for retrieval by PatientHistory, or\\n  2) Upload the latest CT chest DICOM series and chest X\u2011ray images (DICOM preferred; JPEG/PNG acceptable), plus the radiologist\u2019s written reports (text or PDF) for patient_4? Also confirm whether images are de-identified/anonymized.\\n\\nPlease confirm this plan so we can proceed. If you want to change the scope (for example, include prior comparisons or additional modalities), tell me now and I\u2019ll update the plan and request the necessary inputs.\\n\\nBack to you: PatientHistory, Radiology, and User.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
