PatientHistory: validate patient_id, retrieve the latest CT and chest x\u2011ray images and the radiologist\u2019s report, and return a concise timeline and imaging references.\\n2. Radiology: using the provided images and the radiologist\u2019s report, run the imaging tool analysis, produce AI-generated findings for CT and CXR, and note key impressions.\\n3. Orchestrator (me): compare AI findings to the radiologist\u2019s written report, summarize discrepancies or additional findings, and present a concise summary to you.\\n\\nSpecial rule to follow in this session\\n> Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Agents: conclude your response with exactly: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nUser confirmation and a quick question\\n- User, please confirm that the patient ID to use is exactly: \\\"patient_4\\\". If this is correct, I will ask PatientHistory to proceed. If you expect to upload images directly (DICOM/PNG/JPG) rather than have PatientHistory retrieve them, please upload now or tell me.\\n\\nRequests to agents (please proceed)\\n- PatientHistory, please proceed with the following:\\n  - Validate that the patient_id \\\"patient_4\\\" is present and a string.\\n  - Retrieve the latest CT and the latest chest x\u2011ray images (include references/URLs or encoded placeholders) and the radiologist\u2019s report for those studies.\\n  - Return a JSON response per your workflow: set \\\"status\\\" to \\\"success\\\" (or \\\"error\\\" if patient_id invalid), include \\\"patient_id\\\", a structured \\\"patient_timeline\\\" array of events (with imaging entries referencing the CT and CXR and the radiology report), and a concise \\\"history_summary\\\". If you cannot locate images, indicate that clearly.\\n  - After your response, conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nRadiology, please standby and prepare to:\\n  - Accept the images and the radiologist\u2019s report from PatientHistory.\\n  - Run the imaging tool analysis for CT and CXR and prepare AI-generated findings and impressions for each modality.\\n  - After producing findings, compare them to the radiologist\u2019s report and explicitly list any discrepancies or additional findings.\\n  - Conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Once you (user) confirm the patient_id (or upload images if needed), I\u2019ll instruct PatientHistory to retrieve the items. After PatientHistory returns data, I will ask Radiology to analyze and compare. I\u2019ll provide short progress updates after each agent responds.\\n\\nUser, please confirm \\\"patient_4\\\" is correct or upload the images now. If correct and you want me to proceed, say \u201cProceed.\u201d\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
