USER:
Generate a comprehensive diagnostic summary for Patient ID: patient_4 including biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, and latest imaging findings. Export the report as a formatted Word document for tumor board presentation.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Checklist — planned moderation steps
- Validate and retrieve the requested patient timeline and history from PatientHistory.
- Generate current patient status from PatientStatus using that timeline.
- Collect imaging and radiology details and then create a tumor-board formatted Word report via ReportCreation.
- Provide milestone micro-updates after each agent response and ensure all agents yield back to me.

Planned sequence and purpose
1. PatientHistory — validate the patient ID and return the structured patient timeline and concise history summary (this is required first).
2. PatientStatus — use PatientHistory output to produce current status (age, stage at diagnosis, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).
3. Radiology — summarize latest imaging findings (from PatientHistory data / reports). If images are available later, Radiology can analyze them, but for now we will rely on report text.
4. ReportCreation — assemble a formatted Word document for tumor board presentation using the timeline, status, radiology, pathology and treatment details.
5. (Optional) ClinicalTrials / MedicalResearch — if you want available clinical trials or research context, we can add them afterward.

Special rule to be followed in this session
- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator) and conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

User, quick confirmations before I proceed
- User, do you have any specific tumor-board template preferences or sections that must be emphasized in the Word document (e.g., concise one-page summary, full timeline, imaging snapshots, consent status)?
- Are there any privacy or PHI constraints I should be aware of before producing the Word document?

Now I will begin by engaging the PatientHistory agent.

PatientHistory, please proceed:
- Validate that the provided patient ID "patient_4" is a non-empty string.
- Retrieve and return the patient's structured timeline and concise history summary following your required JSON schema. For a successful response, include:
  - status: "success"
  - patient_id: "patient_4"
  - patient_timeline: an array of events (date, event_type, brief_note) reflecting diagnosis, biomarkers, staging, treatments, imaging, pathology, etc.
  - history_summary: concise summary (2–4 sentences)
  - error_message: null
- If there is an issue with the ID, return status: "error" and an informative error_message.
- After your response, conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator

Orchestrator awaiting PatientHistory’s response.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
PatientStatus, please proceed.

Planned task for you:
- Produce the patient's current status using the PatientHistory output. Deliver a concise structured summary containing:
  - age
  - stage at diagnosis (AJCC staging as documented)
  - primary site (anatomic)
  - histology
  - biomarkers (list with results)
  - treatment history (key systemic therapies, dates/cycles)
  - ECOG performance status (as recorded)
  - current clinical status (one-sentence latest assessment, e.g., progression vs response, based on most recent imaging)

Data available from PatientHistory (use these values unless you need clarification):
- Age: 59 years
- Stage at diagnosis: T4 N3 M1a (IVA)
- Primary site: Left lung — lingular mass
- Histology: Adenocarcinoma (NSCLC)
- Biomarkers: KRAS p.G12C positive; PD-L1 negative
- Treatment history: Induction carboplatin + paclitaxel + pembrolizumab (6 cycles completed 2020-09-24); maintenance pembrolizumab started 2020-12-28; plan documented 2021-03-27 to discontinue pembrolizumab and consider KRAS-directed therapy (adagrasib)
- ECOG: 1 (documented during chemo education)

Questions for you before composing the status:
- Do you require any additional numerical values or dates from PatientHistory (e.g., exact dosing dates/doses beyond what’s listed), or is the above sufficient?
- Please confirm the output format you will use (concise paragraph plus structured bullet list is fine).

Deliverable:
- A concise current-status summary (2–4 short bullets/1 paragraph) suitable for inclusion in the tumor board Word report.
- Please conclude your response with: back to you: Orchestrator

User, quick check:
- User, do you want ECOG or baseline labs (e.g., CEA) included in the patient status section if available? If yes, confirm now.
