Orchestrator (me) explains the plan and gathers any missing inputs from you.\\n2. PatientHistory \u2014 validate the patient ID string, retrieve the patient timeline, imaging notes, pathology, and treatment history. (Needs: patient_id as a string.)\\n3. PatientStatus \u2014 use the PatientHistory output to produce current status (stage, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG). (Needs: data from PatientHistory.)\\n4. Radiology \u2014 if imaging files or specific images are available, Radiology will analyze them. (Needs: images or imaging excerpts from PatientHistory.)\\n5. MedicalResearch \u2014 provide relevant literature on typical progression pathways and prognosis drivers for similar profiles. (Needs: keywords derived from PatientStatus/patient profile.)\\n6. (Optional) ClinicalTrials or ReportCreation if you request trial matches or a tumor-board style document.\\n\\nSpecial rule to note\\n- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator) and conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nWhat I need from you now, User\\n- Please confirm you want us to proceed with patient_4. Critically, provide the patient ID exactly as a plain string (for example: \\\"patient_4\\\"). If the ID you intend is different, please provide it now.\\n- If there are any imaging files (CT, PET, x-ray), please upload them or let us know where they are. Radiology needs images to analyze.\\n- Confirm that we may proceed to retrieve and process the clinical details. Also tell us how detailed you want the final short report (e.g., 3\u20135 sentences vs. ~1 paragraph).\\n\\nPatientHistory, please confirm what you need next and be ready to validate the patient_id once the user supplies it. After your work you must end with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nUser, please provide:\\n- patient_id as a string now (e.g., \\\"patient_4\\\")\\n- any imaging files or confirmation that imaging is available in the chart\\n- preferred report length and any other constraints\\n\\nOnce you confirm and provide the patient_id, I will instruct PatientHistory to proceed.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
