PatientHistory \u2014 retrieve the structured timeline and key clinical data for patient_4 (age, stage, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG, imaging availability). This is required before PatientStatus and Radiology.\\n2. Radiology \u2014 if images are available, Radiology will analyze CT/X-ray/PET images supplied by the user or PatientHistory.\\n3. PatientStatus \u2014 synthesize current patient status using PatientHistory outputs.\\n4. ClinicalTrials & ClinicalGuidelines & MedicalResearch (parallel where useful) \u2014 ClinicalTrials and ClinicalGuidelines will use the PatientStatus summary to produce trial matches and guideline-level options (note: I will not provide clinical recommendations myself).\\n5. ReportCreation \u2014 produce a tumor-board\u2013ready document once the above inputs are available.\\n\\nSpecial rule to be observed\\n- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Agents must conclude their responses with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nNext actions I propose\\n- Step A (immediate): Validate patient ID and ask PatientHistory to retrieve the patient timeline and required clinical details for patient_4.\\n- Step B: Ask the user whether any imaging files, pathology reports, or specific items should be uploaded now for Radiology and ReportCreation.\\n\\nUser, a quick confirmation request\\n- User, please confirm that you want me to proceed using patient ID \\\"patient_4\\\". Also let me know if you have imaging files (CT, chest x-ray, PET) or pathology reports to upload now.\\n\\nRequests to agents\\n- PatientHistory, please proceed with retrieving the timeline and clinical details for patient ID \\\"patient_4\\\". Required output:\\n  - Validate that patient ID is a non-empty string.\\n  - Return JSON with \\\"status\\\", \\\"patient_id\\\", \\\"patient_timeline\\\" (structured array of events), \\\"history_summary\\\" (concise), and \\\"error_message\\\": null for success.\\n  - Include key fields needed by PatientStatus: age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG performance status, and list whether imaging/pathology files are available.\\n  - Conclude your response with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nMicro-update expectation\\n- After PatientHistory responds I will provide a 1\u20132 sentence micro-update summarizing what was received and the next step.\\n\\nPlease confirm you want me to proceed with patient_4 and upload any imaging/pathology files now (or say \\\"no files to upload\\\"). Once you confirm, I'll call PatientHistory to retrieve the data.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
