PatientHistory \u2014 retrieve and validate the patient timeline for patient_4 (biomarkers, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, latest imaging findings).\\n2. Radiology \u2014 analyze any imaging (CT/CXR) if images or image reports are available from PatientHistory or uploaded by you.\\n3. PatientStatus \u2014 consolidate current status (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).\\n4. ClinicalTrials \u2014 list relevant trial options (if requested) based on PatientStatus.\\n5.

Radiology will need actual images to perform image-level analysis; otherwise Radiology can summarize from textual imaging reports if provided.\\n- User, do you want the Word document to include identifiable demographics (name, DOB) or should it be de-identified? If de-identified, confirm and indicate what identifiers to omit.\\n\\nNext action plan (pending your confirmation)\\n- After you confirm and/or upload any available files, I will ask PatientHistory to retrieve and return the structured timeline for patient_4. PatientHistory, please proceed when I confirm and include biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, and latest imaging findings in the structured JSON per your workflow and validation rules.
