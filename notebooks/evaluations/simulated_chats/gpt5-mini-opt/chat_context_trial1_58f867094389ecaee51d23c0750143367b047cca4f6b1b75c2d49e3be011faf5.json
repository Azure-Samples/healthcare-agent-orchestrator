PatientHistory: validate patient_id and retrieve the patient timeline, latest CT and CXR radiology reports, and any stored imaging files or access links (DICOM/JPEG). Deliver results in the required JSON schema.\\n2. Radiology: once images and reports are available, run the imaging analysis, compare AI-generated findings with the radiologist\u2019s report, and report discrepancies or additions.\\n3. Orchestrator (me): summarize the combined results and ask you for next steps or clarifications.\\n\\nSpecial rule to all agents (explicit)\\nEach agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent should conclude their response with: \\\"back to you: *Orchestrator*\\\"\\n\\nInitial checks and questions for you (User)\\n- User, please confirm the patient ID is exactly \\\"patient_4\\\" (it must be provided as a string).\\n- User, please upload the latest CT and CXR images (DICOM preferred; JPEG/PNG acceptable) OR confirm that PatientHistory can access them in the record.\\n- User, do you already have the AI-generated imaging findings output? If yes, please upload or paste them. If not, do you want Radiology to run the imaging tool to generate AI findings?\\n- User, please upload or paste the radiologist\u2019s report for the latest CT and CXR if you have it locally (if PatientHistory can fetch it from records, indicate that).\\n\\nRequests to agents now\\n- PatientHistory, please proceed: validate that patient_id \\\"patient_4\\\" is a non-empty string, retrieve the latest CT and CXR radiology reports, imaging metadata and any stored image files or access links. Format your response per your workflow: on success, set \\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\", include \\\"patient_id\\\", an array \\\"patient_timeline\\\" of events (including imaging events), a concise \\\"history_summary\\\", and \\\"error_message\\\":null. If patient_id is missing/invalid, return status \\\"error\\\" with an informative \\\"error_message\\\". Conclude with: back to you: *Orchestrator*.\\n- Radiology, please state what exact inputs you will need to run the imaging tool and produce the comparison (e.g., DICOM images, radiologist report text, AI-findings file). After PatientHistory or the user supplies those, you will perform the image analysis and comparison. Conclude with: back to you: *Orchestrator*.\\n\\nMicro-update after responses\\n- I will give a 1\u20132 sentence micro-update after each agent responds summarizing progress and next steps.\\n\\nPlease confirm this plan or tell me any changes now. Once you confirm and provide the requested uploads (or allow PatientHistory to access records), I will instruct PatientHistory and Radiology to proceed.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
