PatientHistory: validate patient_id and retrieve latest CT and chest x\u2011ray images, the radiologist reports for those studies, and a brief timeline entry for the imaging dates.\\n2. Radiology: analyze the provided CT and CXR images (produce AI-generated findings) and compare them to the radiologist\u2019s report; highlight agreements, discrepancies, and any additional findings.\\n3.
