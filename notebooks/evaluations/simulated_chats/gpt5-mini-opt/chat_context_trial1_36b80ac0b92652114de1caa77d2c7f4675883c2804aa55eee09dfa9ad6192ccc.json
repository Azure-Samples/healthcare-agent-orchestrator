PatientHistory \u2014 validate patient ID and produce the structured patient timeline (required first).\\n2. PatientStatus \u2014 derive current patient status using PatientHistory output (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).\\n3. Radiology \u2014 analyze imaging if images are provided (images can be supplied by PatientHistory or uploaded by you).\\n4. ClinicalGuidelines \u2014 produce guideline-based recommendations (will only be used as input; note: I will not issue treatment recommendations).\\n5. ClinicalTrials \u2014 list relevant trials using PatientStatus.\\n6. ReportCreation \u2014 assemble a tumor-board document using all gathered inputs.\\n7. MedicalResearch \u2014 provide supporting literature if requested.\\n\\nSpecial rule (applies to all agents)\\nEach agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nWhat I need now\\n- User, you provided: Patient ID: patient_4 \u2014 I will proceed if that is the correct patient ID string. Please confirm.\\n- User, please upload any available items for patient_4 if you have them: imaging (CT / PET / chest x-rays), pathology reports (including biomarker panels/molecular testing), age, TNM staging, primary site, histology, prior treatment history, and ECOG performance status. If you cannot upload, say so and I will request PatientHistory to fetch what it can.\\n\\nPatientHistory, please proceed\\n- PatientHistory, please validate that the patient ID is present and is a string (\\\"patient_4\\\"). If valid, retrieve the relevant patient timeline and provide output matching the required JSON schema:\\n  - For success: set \\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\", include \\\"patient_id\\\", a structured array \\\"patient_timeline\\\" of events (dates/brief notes), a concise \\\"history_summary\\\", and set \\\"error_message\\\": null.\\n  - For invalid/missing ID: set \\\"status\\\":\\\"error\\\" and include an informative \\\"error_message\\\".\\n- Deliver concise, structured event details as typically found in patient notes.\\n- After your response, conclude with exactly: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nMicro-update\\n- I have requested validation and the structured timeline for patient_4 from PatientHistory and asked the user for any uploads (imaging, pathology, biomarkers, ECOG). Once PatientHistory returns, I will call PatientStatus and Radiology as appropriate.\\n\\nPlease confirm you want me to proceed with PatientHistory retrieving data for patient_4 now, and upload any files you can.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
