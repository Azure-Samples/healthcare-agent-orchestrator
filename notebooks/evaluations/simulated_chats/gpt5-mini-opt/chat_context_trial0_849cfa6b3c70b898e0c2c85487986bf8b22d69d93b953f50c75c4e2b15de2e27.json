PatientHistory \u2014 validate patient_id and retrieve patient timeline, the latest chest CT and CXR image files (or file IDs/links), and the corresponding radiologist reports. Produce output following your JSON schema (status, patient_id, patient_timeline array, history_summary, error_message).\\n2. Radiology \u2014 once images and reports are available, analyze the CT and CXR images, produce AI-generated findings, compare them to the radiologist\u2019s report, and list discrepancies or additional findings.\\n3. Orchestrator (me) \u2014 provide a concise 1\u20132 sentence micro-update after each agent\u2019s response, then summarize the collective findings and ask if you want further steps.\\n\\nSpecial rule to all agents\\n- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Agents must conclude with exactly: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nQuestions / confirmations before I proceed\\n- User, please confirm you consent to retrieval and analysis of imaging and reports for patient_4 and confirm that by \u201clatest CT and CXR\u201d you mean the most recent chest CT study and the most recent chest x\u2011ray available in the record.\\n- User, do you want any specific focus for the reads (e.g., evaluate for new/progressive nodules or metastases, pleural effusion, consolidation, lines/medical devices), or should we do a general chest CT/CXR comparison?\\n\\nRequests to agents\\n- PatientHistory, please proceed with patient_id \\\"patient_4\\\". Validate that the ID is a non-empty string. Retrieve:\\n  - The latest chest CT images and study identifier (DICOM links or file IDs if available).\\n  - The latest chest x\u2011ray images and study identifier.\\n  - The official radiologist reports for those studies.\\n  - A concise patient_timeline relevant to imaging (dates of imaging, prior relevant imaging, brief context).\\n  - Return a JSON per your workflow: status, patient_id, patient_timeline array, history_summary, error_message (null if successful). Include image file identifiers or links and confirm accessibility for Radiology.\\n  - Conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\n- Radiology, standby to receive the image links and radiologist reports from PatientHistory. After PatientHistory returns data, please:\\n  - Analyze the CT and CXR images and produce AI-generated findings.\\n  - Compare AI findings to the radiologist\u2019s report for each study and list any discrepancies or additional findings, rated by likely clinical significance (concise).\\n  - Provide your analysis in a clearly structured format and conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nPlease confirm you (User) want me to proceed with these steps and whether any additional constraints or focuses are required. Once you confirm, I will instruct PatientHistory to begin.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
