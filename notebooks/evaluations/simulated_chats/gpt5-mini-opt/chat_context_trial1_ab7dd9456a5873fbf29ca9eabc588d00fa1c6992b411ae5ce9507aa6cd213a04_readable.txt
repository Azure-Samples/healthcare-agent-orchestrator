USER:
Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Checklist — planned moderation steps
- Confirm the provided patient ID is valid and request the patient timeline from PatientHistory.
- Use PatientHistory output to sequentially request PatientStatus, Radiology (if images present), ClinicalTrials, ClinicalGuidelines, ReportCreation, and MedicalResearch as needed.
- Ensure each agent returns structured output, yields back to me, and I provide brief milestone updates after each agent response.
- Ask the user for any missing access, files, or specific tumor-board priorities before proceeding.
- Compile inputs (without giving clinical recommendations) and hand them to ReportCreation to produce the tumor-board document.

Planned sequence and purpose
1. PatientHistory — retrieve/validate the patient timeline and key items needed by downstream agents (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG, radiology references/images, pathology summary). This must return the required JSON schema (status, patient_id, patient_timeline[], history_summary, error_message).
2. PatientStatus — create a concise current-status summary using PatientHistory output (age, staging, site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).
3. Radiology — analyze any available imaging (CT, CXR, PET) referenced or provided by PatientHistory; request image files if needed.
4. ClinicalTrials — use PatientStatus to identify relevant trial options.
5. ClinicalGuidelines — summarize guideline-based considerations (note: not giving a treatment plan) using PatientStatus.
6. MedicalResearch — optional: provide background literature or research on a requested topic or on treatments/trials identified.
7. ReportCreation — assemble a tumor-board Word document using all collected inputs.

Special rule (applies to all agents)
Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent must conclude their response with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

Next actions — asking for input and permissions
- User, I have patient_id = "patient_4" (string). Please confirm you want me to proceed to retrieve/compile the tumor board materials for this patient.
- User, do you have any additional constraints or priorities for the tumor board (e.g., date of tumor board meeting, specific clinical questions to highlight, whether to include palliative/supportive care options, or any HIPAA/consent considerations)?
- User, do you have imaging files, pathology reports, or other documents you prefer to upload here instead of having agents pull from records? If so, please upload or indicate.

Request to PatientHistory
PatientHistory, please proceed with retrieving and validating the timeline for patient_id "patient_4". Required outputs and format:
- Validate that patient_id is present and a string. If invalid, return status="error" with a clear error_message.
- If valid, return JSON with:
  - status: "success"
  - patient_id: "patient_4"
  - patient_timeline: an array of structured events (date, event_type, brief details) including age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG performance status, pathology summary, and references/links to any imaging files you find.
  - history_summary: concise summary (1–3 sentences)
  - error_message: null
Also tell me what additional access or files you need (e.g., imaging DICOMs, pathology slides). Conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator

User confirmation request
- Please confirm I should proceed with the above plan and that I may instruct PatientHistory to retrieve records for patient_4. If you want any change to the participant order or scope, tell me now.

Micro-update policy
- After PatientHistory responds I will provide a 1–2 sentence micro-update summarizing progress and next steps before engaging PatientStatus (and so on for each agent).

Waiting for confirmation
- User, please confirm and provide any uploads/access details.
- PatientHistory, await confirmation from the user and then proceed as instructed above.
