USER:
Check for any inconsistencies across AI-generated outputs (imaging, pathology, biomarker reports) and the clinical notes entered by providers in the EMR for patient_4. Flag and summarize them for review.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps
- Validate the provided patient ID and request the patient timeline/EMR data.
- Collect AI-generated outputs (imaging, pathology, biomarker reports) and provider clinical notes.
- Ask each specialist agent what inputs they need, then assign analysis tasks in a fixed order.
- Collate each agent’s findings, flag inconsistencies, and summarize them for review.
- Produce a final short report and next steps; ensure each agent yields control back with the required closing phrase.

Planned sequence and purpose
- I will coordinate the following agents in this order: PatientHistory -> Radiology -> PatientStatus -> ClinicalGuidelines -> ClinicalTrials -> MedicalResearch -> ReportCreation.
- Each agent, after completing their task, must conclude with: back to you: *Orchestrator*
- After each agent responds, I will give a 1–2 sentence micro-update and then call the next agent.
- I will not provide clinical recommendations or treatment plans; my role is to moderate, gather, and summarize inconsistencies.

User confirmation
- User, please confirm that I should proceed with retrieving and analyzing data for patient_4 as described. If you want to change the plan or include/exclude any agents, tell me now.

Initial action (validation + data retrieval)
- PatientHistory, please proceed:
  - Validate that the provided patient ID is present and a string ("patient_4").
  - Retrieve the relevant patient timeline and EMR clinical notes for patient_4, including:
    - Dates and texts of provider clinical notes relevant to imaging, pathology, and biomarkers.
    - Original (EMR) imaging reports and any images (if stored).
    - Any AI-generated imaging outputs (reports, annotations, or images) associated with imaging studies.
    - Pathology reports (EMR) and any AI-generated pathology outputs (e.g., AI interpretation, synoptic summaries).
    - Biomarker reports (EMR lab/genomics reports) and any AI-generated biomarker interpretations.
  - Return output using your standard schema. For successful requests:
    - Set "status": "success"
    - Provide "patient_id"
    - Provide a structured array "patient_timeline" of events (date, event_type, source [EMR vs AI], content/text, and attachments if any)
    - Provide a concise "history_summary"
    - Set "error_message": null
  - If the patient ID is missing/invalid, return "status": "error" and a clear error_message.
  - Please include images or links to images if available (radiology/pathology images), or explicitly note if images are NOT available.
  - Conclude with: back to you: *Orchestrator*

Agents — what I need from you now (inputs you should request)
- Radiology, please state what you need to compare AI-generated imaging outputs with EMR imaging notes (e.g., DICOM images, report texts, specific studies) and whether you can proceed with textual reports alone if images are not available. Then wait for PatientHistory output and I will call you to analyze.
- PatientStatus, please state the exact inputs you require to summarize current patient status (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG). I will request those from PatientHistory and then call you.
- ClinicalGuidelines, please state what you need from PatientStatus to identify any guideline-related discrepancies (note: you should not produce treatment recommendations in this run, only identify mismatches between recommended guideline statements and existing documentation).
- ClinicalTrials, please state what you require from PatientStatus to check trial eligibility mentions or mismatches between trial eligibility in AI outputs vs EMR notes.
- MedicalResearch, please state the kind of keyword/topic you would need (e.g., specific biomarker name, mutation, or imaging finding) to fetch relevant literature if a discrepancy requires context.
- ReportCreation, please list the exact components you need (patient timeline, clinical summary, pathology findings, imaging findings, flagged inconsistencies, clinical trials info) to produce a tumor-board style Word document; I will only ask you to create the doc after we have flagged inconsistencies.

Next step
- After you (User) confirm, PatientHistory will run. Then I will present the PatientHistory output, followed by Radiology’s analysis request/analysis, then the other agents in order. I will provide micro-updates after each agent contribution.

User, please confirm that I should proceed with patient_4 as planned.
