USER:
Generate a comprehensive diagnostic summary for Patient ID: patient_4 including biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, and latest imaging findings. Export the report as a formatted Word document for tumor board presentation.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation checklist
- Validate the provided patient ID and retrieve the complete patient timeline and key data elements.
- Gather patient status (age, stage, site, histology, biomarkers, ECOG, treatment history) from PatientHistory and summarize.
- Collect latest imaging and pathology details (ask the user to upload images/reports if available) and route to Radiology if image files are provided.
- Assemble required inputs for the tumor-board Word report and ask ReportCreation to produce the document.
- Confirm each agent's output, provide micro-updates after each step, and then present the final assembled brief and file to you.

Planned sequence and responsibilities (each agent will yield back to me when done)
1. PatientHistory — validate patient ID and return structured timeline + concise history summary (this is the required first step).
2. PatientStatus — derive current status (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatments, ECOG) from PatientHistory output.
3. Radiology — provide imaging interpretation if image files (CT/PET/x-ray) are available; otherwise summarize imaging reports from PatientHistory. (If you upload imaging files, Radiology will need them to do image analysis.)
4. ClinicalTrials — list relevant trial options based on PatientStatus (no treatment recommendations).
5. ReportCreation — compile a formatted Word document for tumor board using the assembled inputs.

Special rule to all agents and to you
- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent should conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

Immediate actions and what I need now
- *Patient*, please confirm that the patient ID is patient_4 (you provided this) and, if available, upload any imaging files (CT, PET, x-ray) and pathology reports you want included in the tumor board document. If no imaging files are available, confirm that including imaging report text is acceptable.
- *PatientHistory*, please proceed with validating the patient ID "patient_4" (confirm it's a non-empty string), retrieve the patient's timeline and all relevant elements below, and return the required JSON with:
  - status ("success" or "error")
  - patient_id
  - patient_timeline (structured array of events: dates, event type, brief details)
  - history_summary (concise)
  - error_message (null if success)
  PatientHistory, please include or indicate the following in the timeline so downstream agents can proceed: age, stage at diagnosis, primary site, histology, biomarker status (EGFR, ALK, PD-L1, etc.), full treatment history (dates and regimens), ECOG performance status, pathology findings, CT/PET/x-ray report texts or links to image files, social history (smoking, etc.). If any of these are unavailable in records, state what is missing.
  Please also indicate whether imaging files are available and, if so, provide filenames or access instructions.

User confirmation request
- *User*, please confirm you want the tumor-board Word document (DOCX) formatted with: title slide (patient ID, name if you want included), 1-page clinical summary, timeline slide(s), imaging slide(s), pathology summary, current status, and treatment history. Also confirm whether you want identifiable information included or redacted.

If you confirm, PatientHistory will start. Once PatientHistory returns, I will give a 1–2 sentence micro-update and call the next agent (PatientStatus).
