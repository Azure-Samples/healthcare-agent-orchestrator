PatientHistory \u2014 validate patient ID, retrieve latest CT and CXR images and the radiologist\u2019s report (and imaging dates).\\n2. Radiology \u2014 analyze the provided CT and CXR images with the imaging tool and produce AI-generated findings.\\n3. Orchestrator \u2014 compare Radiology\u2019s findings to the radiologist\u2019s report, summarize discrepancies or additional findings, and present the result to you.\\n\\nSpecial rule (applies to all agents)\\n- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator) and conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nBefore I proceed, I need two things from you and two confirmations\\n\\n1) *User*, please confirm the patient ID: is \\\"patient_4\\\" the correct patient ID (as a string)? If not, provide the exact patient ID string now.  \\n2) *User*, please provide/upload the latest CT and chest x-ray (CXR) image files and the radiologist\u2019s written report (if you have them). If you cannot upload images here, tell me whether PatientHistory has access to these images in your system.\\n\\nNext, I will request the necessary data from the agents. If you confirm the ID and either allow PatientHistory to fetch the files or upload them now, I will start.\\n\\nAgent prompts I will send now\\n- *PatientHistory*, please validate that the patient ID \\\"patient_4\\\" is provided and is a string. If valid, retrieve the latest CT and CXR image files (with imaging dates) and the corresponding radiologist report for patient_4. Return the imaging file formats available (DICOM, JPEG, etc.), the imaging dates, and the report text. If the patient ID is missing/invalid, return an error JSON per your workflow. Conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\n- *Radiology*, please confirm what image formats you require (DICOM preferred) and any additional metadata (e.g., series needed, contrast phase for CT). After PatientHistory supplies the images, you will analyze the CT and CXR using the imaging tool and produce AI-generated findings (structured and concise). Conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nPlease confirm the plan so I can instruct PatientHistory to proceed. If you have the images and report ready, you may upload them now instead of having PatientHistory fetch them.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
