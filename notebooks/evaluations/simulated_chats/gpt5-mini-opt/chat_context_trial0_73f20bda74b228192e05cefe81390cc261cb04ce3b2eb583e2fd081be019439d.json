Example: \\\"patient_12345\\\".\\n- Upload the pathology and molecular testing reports (PDFs, images or text). If the reports are in an EHR and you want PatientHistory to fetch them, please confirm access and note where they are stored.\\n- Tell me whether you want me to scan for all reported biomarkers or focus on specific ones (examples: EGFR, ALK, ROS1, KRAS, BRAF, RET, NTRK, HER2, PD-L1, MSI, TMB). If you don\u2019t specify, I will look for all biomarkers reported in the documents.\\n- Confirm you consent to parsing these documents for the purpose of extracting biomarker information.\\n\\nUser prompt (please respond)\\n- User, can you provide the patient ID as a string and upload the pathology/molecular testing reports (or confirm EHR access)? Also tell me whether to search for all biomarkers or only specific ones from the list above.\\n\\nAgent prompt\\n- PatientHistory, please confirm you can proceed once the user provides a patient ID string and any uploaded reports. Indicate any additional requirements you need to produce a structured patient_timeline and history_summary (per your workflow). Then wait for the user input. back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nNext step after your response\\n- Once the user supplies the patient ID and reports (and confirms scope), I will direct PatientHistory to validate and retrieve the documents. After that, I will instruct MedicalResearch to extract and list the biomarkers found and provide a concise summary.
