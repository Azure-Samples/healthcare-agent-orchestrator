USER:
Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Checklist — planned moderation steps
- Confirm and validate the provided patient ID and request any missing materials (images, reports).
- Retrieve a structured patient timeline from PatientHistory.
- Pass the extracted status to PatientStatus, then route needed data to Radiology, ClinicalTrials, ClinicalGuidelines, MedicalResearch, and ReportCreation in sequence.
- Collect each agent's output, provide short milestone updates, and assemble a final concise summary for the tumor board package.
- Ask the user for confirmation to proceed and any additional files (imaging, pathology, labs).

Planned sequence and purpose (order of participants)
1. PatientHistory — retrieve and return a validated patient timeline for the provided patient ID (required first).
2. PatientStatus — derive current clinical status from PatientHistory output (age, staging, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).
3. Radiology — analyze any imaging provided (needs images or links; can accept images exported by PatientHistory if available).
4. ClinicalTrials — list appropriate trials based on PatientStatus.
5. ClinicalGuidelines — provide guideline-based treatment options (using PatientStatus) — note: Orchestrator will not endorse or recommend treatment; this agent provides guideline content only.
6. MedicalResearch — provide recent research literature on specific queries (needs keywords/topics).
7. ReportCreation — compile a tumor-board-ready document (needs integrated timeline and findings from prior agents).

Special rule to all agents (explicit)
- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me by concluding their reply with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

User confirmation and materials needed before we proceed
- User, please confirm that the intended patient ID is exactly: "patient_4".
- User, please upload any available imaging (CT/MRI/PET/x-ray) and pathology reports, or indicate that none are available.
- User, if you want specific trials or research topics prioritized, state relevant keywords (e.g., "EGFR-mutant lung cancer", "HER2+ breast cancer", etc.).

Request to PatientHistory
- PatientHistory, please proceed with retrieving and validating the timeline for patient_id = "patient_4". Per your workflow, validate that the patient ID is a non-empty string. If valid, return a JSON object with:
  - status: "success"
  - patient_id: "patient_4"
  - patient_timeline: an array of structured events (date, event_type, brief details)
  - history_summary: a concise summary (2–4 sentences)
  - error_message: null
If the patient ID is missing or invalid, return:
  - status: "error"
  - error_message: explanation of the issue
Also indicate if you need any additional documents (imaging, pathology, labs) from the user to complete this task.
Please conclude your response with: back to you: Orchestrator

Next steps after PatientHistory responds
- I will provide a 1–2 sentence micro-update and then call PatientStatus with the PatientHistory output (or ask the user for missing pieces if needed).

Please confirm you want us to proceed with PatientHistory retrieving the timeline for "patient_4", and upload any available images or reports now if you have them.
