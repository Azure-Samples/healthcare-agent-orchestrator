USER:
Given the presence of a KRAS p.G12C mutation, what are the potential benefits and risks of transitioning to KRAS-directed treatment with adagrasib? How might this change the patient's prognosis?

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Checklist — my planned moderation steps
- Clarify whether you want a general evidence summary or a patient-specific assessment.
- Gather necessary patient details (or a valid patient ID) to enable patient-specific inputs.
- Ask PatientStatus what exact data it needs, then request that info from you.
- Query MedicalResearch for evidence on adagrasib (benefits, risks, resistance) and ClinicalGuidelines for guideline context (without giving treatment recommendations).
- Share each agent's input back to you, summarize progress, and ask for confirmation or next steps.

Planned participants and sequence
1) PatientStatus — to synthesize current patient status (requires patient details). PatientStatus, please list what you need below. Each agent must conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator".
2) MedicalResearch — to summarize clinical trial evidence for adagrasib (efficacy, common/serious adverse events, resistance mechanisms).
3) ClinicalGuidelines — to provide guideline-contextual information (indications/approval status and guideline positioning) — note: no clinical recommendations or personalized treatment plans.
4) ClinicalTrials (optional if you want alternatives) — to list relevant trials for KRAS G12C patients.
5) ReportCreation (optional) — to assemble a tumor-board style document if desired.

User — I need a clarification to proceed
- Do you want a general evidence-based summary about adagrasib for KRAS p.G12C (non–patient-specific), or do you want an assessment of how switching to adagrasib might affect a specific patient's prognosis?
- If you want a patient-specific assessment, please either:
  a) Provide a valid patient ID (string) so PatientHistory can retrieve the timeline (Note: PatientHistory requires a patient ID string), or
  b) Provide the following patient details directly:
     - Primary cancer site and histology (e.g., non–small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma)
     - Current stage and sites of metastasis (if any)
     - Age
     - ECOG performance status
     - Prior systemic therapies and lines of treatment
     - Biomarkers besides KRAS p.G12C (PD-L1, EGFR, ALK, MET, etc.)
     - Significant comorbidities (hepatic/renal dysfunction, interstitial lung disease, cardiac disease)
     - Concomitant medications (especially strong CYP3A inhibitors/inducers)
     - Presence of symptomatic brain metastases

PatientStatus, please proceed
- PatientStatus, what specific data elements do you require (and in what format) to provide a concise current-status summary usable by the other agents? Please respond listing the fields and expected formats. Each agent must end with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

Next steps after your reply
- If you choose general evidence summary: I will call MedicalResearch and ClinicalGuidelines to provide the benefits, risks, likely impact on prognosis (based on published data and guideline context), and common resistance mechanisms.
- If you provide patient-specific data or a patient ID: I will first have PatientStatus summarize the current status, then route that to MedicalResearch and ClinicalGuidelines for personalized-context evidence and guideline framing.

Please confirm which path you prefer and provide either the patient ID (string) or the requested patient details.
