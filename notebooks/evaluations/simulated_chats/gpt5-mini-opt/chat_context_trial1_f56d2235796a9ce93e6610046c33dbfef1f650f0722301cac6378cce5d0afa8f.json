PatientHistory: Retrieve/produce the structured patient timeline and core clinical details (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG if available). This is required first because many other agents depend on it.\\n2. Radiology: Review any imaging (CT, CXR, PET) provided by PatientHistory or by you and provide radiologic insights.\\n3. PatientStatus: Consolidate current patient status using the PatientHistory output (age, staging, histology, biomarkers, prior treatments, ECOG).\\n4. ClinicalTrials: Using PatientStatus, list potential applicable clinical trials (informational only).\\n5. ClinicalGuidelines: Using PatientStatus, provide guideline-based treatment pathways (informational only; no direct recommendations).\\n6. ReportCreation: Assemble a draft tumor-board Word document using all collected inputs.\\n7. MedicalResearch (if requested): Provide literature or research context about specific therapies or biomarkers.\\n\\nSpecial rule to be followed in all exchanges\\n- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent must conclude their response with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nValidation of patient ID\\n- Provided patient ID: \\\"patient_4\\\" \u2014 validated as a non-empty string. Proceeding on that basis.\\n\\nWhat I need from you before I start\\nUser, please confirm that you want me to proceed with Patient ID \\\"patient_4\\\".\\nUser, please also provide any of the following items if available (these will speed and complete the preparation):\\n- Recent imaging files or links (CT chest/abdomen/pelvis, PET-CT, chest X-rays) \u2014 Radiology will need images.\\n- Pathology report(s) (histology, IHC, molecular testing / biomarkers).\\n- Current staging (if known), or clinical notes that indicate staging.\\n- Age and ECOG performance status.\\n- Full treatment history (surgery, chemo, radiation, targeted therapies, dates).\\n- Any clinical trial preferences or exclusion criteria.\\n- Social history or comorbidities to include in the tumor-board summary (optional).\\n\\nIf you confirm, here is the immediate next step I will take\\n- I will ask PatientHistory to retrieve and present the structured patient timeline for patient_id \\\"patient_4\\\". PatientHistory, please proceed to retrieve the patient timeline for patient_id \\\"patient_4\\\". Provide the JSON output per your schema: status, patient_id, patient_timeline (array of events), history_summary, error_message (null if success). If you need additional details from the user to complete the timeline, list them. Conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nPlease confirm that I should proceed with PatientHistory now, or provide any of the requested materials first.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
