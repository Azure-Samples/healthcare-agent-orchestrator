PatientHistory \u2014 validate patient ID and return structured timeline JSON (required first).\\n  2. Radiology \u2014 analyze imaging if images are provided (needs image files or references from PatientHistory).\\n  3. PatientStatus \u2014 synthesize current status (needs age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).\\n  4. ClinicalTrials \u2014 suggest applicable trials (needs PatientStatus output).\\n  5. ClinicalGuidelines \u2014 summarize guideline-based options (needs PatientStatus output).\\n  6. MedicalResearch \u2014 provide background or literature on requested topics (needs keyword/topic).\\n  7. ReportCreation \u2014 assemble the tumor board Word document (needs timeline, summaries, imaging/pathology findings, and treatment/trials info).\\n\\nSpecial rule to all participants (explicit)\\n- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent must conclude their response with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nInitial requests and data needs\\n- User, please confirm that the patient ID is correct: \\\"patient_4\\\".\\n- User, please provide any available attachments now: imaging files (CT, PET, X-ray), pathology report(s), biomarker results, and any recent clinic notes or labs you want included.\\n- Note: Radiology requires the actual image files (DICOMs or high-resolution images). If you cannot provide images, Radiology can only review imaging reports or comment at a high level from descriptions.\\n- PatientStatus will require: age, staging, primary tumor site, histology, biomarkers, prior treatment history, and ECOG performance status. If those items are in the records you will upload, PatientHistory should return them; otherwise please supply them directly.\\n\\nPlan for PatientHistory\\n- *PatientHistory*, please proceed with the following:\\n  1. Validate the patient ID is present and a string (patient_id = \\\"patient_4\\\").\\n  2. Retrieve the relevant patient timeline data and produce a JSON response matching your workflow:\\n     - On success: set \\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\", include \\\"patient_id\\\", \\\"patient_timeline\\\" (structured array of events), \\\"history_summary\\\" (concise), and \\\"error_message\\\": null.\\n     - On error (missing/invalid ID): set \\\"status\\\":\\\"error\\\" and an informative \\\"error_message\\\".\\n  3. Ensure timeline includes imaging reports (and filenames if attachments exist), pathology findings, biomarker results, treatments, and dates where available.\\n  4. Conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nUser confirmation\\n- User, do you confirm this plan and that I should ask PatientHistory to proceed now for patient_4? If yes, please also upload any imaging, pathology, or other documents you have. If you want to change the plan (e.g., skip certain agents), tell me which agents to include or exclude.\\n\\nMicro-update (current)\\n- I will now request PatientHistory to retrieve the timeline for patient_4. Once PatientHistory returns the JSON, I will summarize it, identify any missing items, and then call Radiology if imaging is available. Next steps will be shared after PatientHistory responds.\\n\\nNext action (with your confirmation)\\n- If you confirm, I will instruct PatientHistory to begin now.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
