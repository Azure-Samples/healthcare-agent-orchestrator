USER:
Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Checklist — planned moderation steps
- Validate patient ID and request the PatientHistory timeline per its required JSON schema.
- Identify missing clinical materials (images, pathology, biomarkers) and request them from the user.
- Sequence agent contributions (PatientHistory → Radiology → PatientStatus → ClinicalTrials → ClinicalGuidelines → MedicalResearch → ReportCreation), collecting each agent’s outputs and returning control to the Orchestrator after each.
- Produce milestone micro-updates after each agent response and summarize all inputs at the end.

Purpose, plan, and participant order
- Purpose: Prepare a tumor-board packet for patient_4 by collecting structured patient timeline/history, imaging interpretation, patient status, relevant trials/guidelines, optional research support, and a final Word report for tumor board review.
- Expected participation order:
  1. PatientHistory — validate patient ID and return structured timeline JSON (required first).
  2. Radiology — analyze imaging if images are provided (needs image files or references from PatientHistory).
  3. PatientStatus — synthesize current status (needs age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).
  4. ClinicalTrials — suggest applicable trials (needs PatientStatus output).
  5. ClinicalGuidelines — summarize guideline-based options (needs PatientStatus output).
  6. MedicalResearch — provide background or literature on requested topics (needs keyword/topic).
  7. ReportCreation — assemble the tumor board Word document (needs timeline, summaries, imaging/pathology findings, and treatment/trials info).

Special rule to all participants (explicit)
- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent must conclude their response with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

Initial requests and data needs
- User, please confirm that the patient ID is correct: "patient_4".
- User, please provide any available attachments now: imaging files (CT, PET, X-ray), pathology report(s), biomarker results, and any recent clinic notes or labs you want included.
- Note: Radiology requires the actual image files (DICOMs or high-resolution images). If you cannot provide images, Radiology can only review imaging reports or comment at a high level from descriptions.
- PatientStatus will require: age, staging, primary tumor site, histology, biomarkers, prior treatment history, and ECOG performance status. If those items are in the records you will upload, PatientHistory should return them; otherwise please supply them directly.

Plan for PatientHistory
- *PatientHistory*, please proceed with the following:
  1. Validate the patient ID is present and a string (patient_id = "patient_4").
  2. Retrieve the relevant patient timeline data and produce a JSON response matching your workflow:
     - On success: set "status":"success", include "patient_id", "patient_timeline" (structured array of events), "history_summary" (concise), and "error_message": null.
     - On error (missing/invalid ID): set "status":"error" and an informative "error_message".
  3. Ensure timeline includes imaging reports (and filenames if attachments exist), pathology findings, biomarker results, treatments, and dates where available.
  4. Conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator

User confirmation
- User, do you confirm this plan and that I should ask PatientHistory to proceed now for patient_4? If yes, please also upload any imaging, pathology, or other documents you have. If you want to change the plan (e.g., skip certain agents), tell me which agents to include or exclude.

Micro-update (current)
- I will now request PatientHistory to retrieve the timeline for patient_4. Once PatientHistory returns the JSON, I will summarize it, identify any missing items, and then call Radiology if imaging is available. Next steps will be shared after PatientHistory responds.

Next action (with your confirmation)
- If you confirm, I will instruct PatientHistory to begin now.
