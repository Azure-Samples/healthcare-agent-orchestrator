PatientHistory \u2014 validate patient_id and return the structured timeline and required clinical details for patient_4.\\n2. PatientStatus \u2014 synthesize current status from PatientHistory output (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers incl. KRAS, treatment history, ECOG).\\n3. ClinicalTrials \u2014 identify active clinical trials matching the patient status and geographic constraints; include trial phase and contact info.\\n4. (If needed) MedicalResearch \u2014 provide background or search refinement on specific trial mechanisms or experimental agents.\\n5. Back to Orchestrator \u2014 consolidate and present results to you.\\n\\nSpecial rule (applies to all agents)\\nEach agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent must conclude their response with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nImmediate actions and information needed\\n- *User*, please confirm that the target patient ID is \\\"patient_4\\\" (exact string). If that is correct, please provide the patient\u2019s geographic location (city or ZIP/postal code and country) and any constraints about travel or distance (e.g., willing to travel nationally vs. only local within X miles/km). Also indicate whether trial phase limits are preferred (e.g., only Phase II/III).\\n- *PatientHistory*, please proceed with validating the patient_id \\\"patient_4\\\" (ensure it is a non-empty string) and then retrieve and return the patient's structured timeline and the following specific items needed by PatientStatus:\\n  - Age\\n  - Cancer primary site and histology\\n  - Stage (TNM or stage grouping)\\n  - Biomarkers (explicitly include KRAS mutation status and other relevant markers)\\n  - Treatment history (lines of therapy, dates, agents)\\n  - ECOG performance status\\n  - Any known geographic or logistical constraints on trial participation (if recorded)\\n  \\n  Please format your response per your workflow:\\n  - If successful, return JSON with \\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\", \\\"patient_id\\\":\\\"patient_4\\\", \\\"patient_timeline\\\":[...structured events...], \\\"history_summary\\\":\\\"concise summary\\\", and \\\"error_message\\\": null.\\n  - If patient_id is missing or invalid, return JSON with \\\"status\\\":\\\"error\\\" and an informative \\\"error_message\\\".\\n  - Conclude with the required phrase: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nUser prompt (required)\\n- *User*, please confirm the patient ID (\\\"patient_4\\\") and provide:\\n  1) patient geographic location (city/ZIP/country),\\n  2) maximum travel distance or willingness to travel (local, regional, national, international),\\n  3) any phase restrictions (e.g., exclude Phase I),\\n  4) whether they prefer trials with certain enrollment criteria (e.g., only trials for KRAS G12C vs any KRAS mutation), and\\n  5) permission to use de-identified clinical details to search trials.\\n\\nNext step after your confirmation\\n- Once you confirm and PatientHistory returns the patient data, I will direct PatientStatus to synthesize the current status, then ask ClinicalTrials to search for matching active trials in your specified geographic area. I will provide micro-updates after each agent completes their task.\\n\\nNow proceeding: *PatientHistory*, please validate and retrieve details for patient_id \\\"patient_4\\\" as described above. back to you: Orchestrator\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
