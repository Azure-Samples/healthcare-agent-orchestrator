PatientHistory \u2014 retrieve and return validated structured data for patient_id \\\"patient_4\\\" (required first).\\n2. PatientStatus \u2014 summarize current status (age, staging, site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).\\n3. Radiology \u2014 analyze imaging findings (needs images or imaging reports from PatientHistory).\\n4. (Optional) ClinicalTrials / ClinicalGuidelines \u2014 include if you request trial options or guideline recommendations (these need PatientStatus).\\n5. ReportCreation \u2014 assemble and export the tumor-board Word document using inputs from PatientHistory, PatientStatus, Radiology, and optionally ClinicalTrials/Guidelines.\\nSpecial rule (applies to all agents)\\n- Each agent, after completing their task, must conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nValidation of patient ID\\n- I have received patient ID: \\\"patient_4\\\" (string). This satisfies PatientHistory's requirement to proceed.\\n\\nNow I will request the necessary data from PatientHistory so we can proceed.\\n\\nPatientHistory, please proceed with the following for patient_id \\\"patient_4\\\":\\n- Validate the patient_id and return status (\\\"success\\\" or \\\"error\\\"). If error, include an informative error_message.\\n- If success, produce:\\n  - patient_id (echo the input)\\n  - patient_timeline: a structured array of events (date, event_type, brief details). Include diagnosis date, staging at diagnosis, pathology results (including histology and biomarker panel with values like EGFR, ALK, ROS1, PD-L1 % or others), treatments given (dates, regimens, cycles, responses), recent labs if relevant, ECOG performance status, and any comorbidities/social history.\\n  - history_summary: concise 2\u20134 sentence summary.\\n  - error_message: null on success.\\n- If imaging files (CT/PET/x-ray) or full radiology reports are available in the patient record, please attach or include the radiology reports and indicate file names for images (so Radiology can request or analyze them).\\n- Provide the output in the PatientHistory JSON schema (status, patient_id, patient_timeline array, history_summary, error_message).\\n- After completing, conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nPatientHistory, what additional information or files (e.g., DICOM CT, chest x-ray images, pathology PDF) do you need from the user to provide a complete response for patient_4?\\n\\nUser, before PatientHistory responds:\\n- Please confirm you want the full tumor-board Word report (including imaging and pathology appendices) exported.\\n- Do you want inclusion of clinical trial options or guideline-based treatment recommendations in the report? (Yes/No)\\n- If you have imaging files (DICOM CT/PET or JPEG/PNG x-rays) or pathology reports to upload, please provide them now or indicate they are available in the record.\\n\\nNext steps once PatientHistory responds\\n- I will give a 1\u20132 sentence micro-update and then call PatientStatus (and Radiology if imaging is provided) using the data from PatientHistory.\\n- After PatientStatus and Radiology outputs, I will offer an option to include ClinicalTrials/ClinicalGuidelines before invoking them.\\n- Finally, I will call ReportCreation to assemble the Word document and return it to you.\\n\\nPlease confirm the above plan and answer the user questions about inclusion of trials/guidelines and availability of imaging/pathology files so we can proceed.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
