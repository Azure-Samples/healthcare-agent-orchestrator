USER:
Can you scan all pathology and molecular testing to see if these biomarkers are present

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Checklist — planned moderation steps
- Confirm required inputs (patient ID string, pathology/molecular reports, and biomarkers of interest).
- Validate inputs and task assignment to PatientHistory to extract pathology/molecular findings.
- If needed, route extracted results to MedicalResearch for clarifying biomarker definitions or to PatientStatus for status aggregation.
- Return parsed results to you, summarize next steps, and ask for confirmation before continuing.

Planned sequence and roles (what will happen next)
1. PatientHistory — validate the patient ID, retrieve/scan the provided pathology and molecular reports, and produce a structured patient_timeline plus a concise history_summary that lists detected biomarkers and their values. PatientHistory: after you finish, yield back with "back to you: Orchestrator".
2. MedicalResearch — if we need clarification about biomarker definitions, variants, or assay interpretation (not clinical recommendations), MedicalResearch will provide supporting information. MedicalResearch: after you finish, yield back with "back to you: Orchestrator".
3. (Optional) PatientStatus — if you’d like an assembled current status using the extracted biomarkers and other clinical info, PatientStatus can compile that. PatientStatus: after you finish, yield back with "back to you: Orchestrator".

Special rule (must follow)
- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator) and conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator

What I need from you now
User, please provide:
1) The patient ID as a string (required). Example: "PAT12345"
2) The pathology and molecular testing reports to scan — either as uploaded files (PDF, images) or pasted text. If you have many documents, group them or indicate order.
3) A list of biomarkers you want us to look for (examples: EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, KRAS, HER2, NTRK, PD-L1, MSI, TMB, RET). If you want us to scan for all reported biomarkers, say "scan all".
4) Any format preference for the output (JSON for machine parsing, or human-readable summary).

PatientHistory, please confirm what you specifically require beyond the above (file types, naming conventions) to validate the patient ID and extract pathology/molecular findings, and confirm readiness to proceed once the user supplies the inputs. PatientHistory: after you finish, yield back with "back to you: Orchestrator".

Micro-update after inputs are provided: I will summarize what was uploaded and then assign PatientHistory to extract the biomarker data. Please confirm you agree with this plan or indicate changes.
