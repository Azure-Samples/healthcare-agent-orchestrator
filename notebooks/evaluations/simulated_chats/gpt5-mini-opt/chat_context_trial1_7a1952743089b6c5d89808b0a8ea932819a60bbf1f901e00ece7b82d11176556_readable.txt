USER:
Check for any inconsistencies across AI-generated outputs (imaging, pathology, biomarker reports) and the clinical notes entered by providers in the EMR for patient_4. Flag and summarize them for review.

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation checklist
- Confirm a valid patient ID is provided and request the structured patient timeline from PatientHistory.
- Retrieve and review AI-generated outputs (imaging, pathology, biomarker) vs EMR clinical notes for inconsistencies.
- Route specific items to domain agents as needed (Radiology, PatientStatus, ClinicalTrials, ReportCreation, MedicalResearch) for clarification.
- Summarize and flag inconsistencies for review and present a concise report for the user.

Planned sequence and participation order
1. PatientHistory — retrieve the full structured timeline and EMR clinical notes for patient_4. (Required first step.)
2. Orchestrator — review the returned timeline and decide which domain agents are needed.
3. Radiology / Pathology / PatientStatus / ClinicalTrials / MedicalResearch / ReportCreation — each engaged only if needed to clarify or reconcile specific inconsistencies.
4. Orchestrator — synthesize findings, flag inconsistencies, and present summary for review.

Important rule to follow in this session
> Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent should conclude their response with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

Validation check
- The user provided patient ID: "patient_4" (string) — valid. Proceeding to request PatientHistory data.

Next action (request to agent)
- PatientHistory, please proceed with retrieving patient timeline and EMR clinical notes for patient_id = "patient_4". Per your workflow, return a JSON object with:
  - status ("success" or "error")
  - patient_id
  - patient_timeline (array of structured events: date, event_type, source [EMR note, AI-imaging-report, AI-pathology-report, biomarker-report], short text of content)
  - history_summary (concise)
  - error_message (null if success)
- If additional clarifying fields are needed, please state them before retrieving.
PatientHistory, please proceed. Conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

User question for you
- User, do you want the check limited to only AI-generated imaging/pathology/biomarker reports that are recorded in the EMR, or should I also search for external AI report files you may have? If external files exist, please upload or indicate where they are stored.

Please confirm or adjust the plan so I can proceed.
