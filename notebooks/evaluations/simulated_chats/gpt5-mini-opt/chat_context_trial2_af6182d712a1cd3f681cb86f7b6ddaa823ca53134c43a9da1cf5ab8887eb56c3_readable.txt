ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Checklist — my planned moderation steps
- Validate the patient ID and confirm we have permission to proceed.
- Request the patient timeline and structured data from PatientHistory.
- Use PatientHistory output to request patient status (PatientStatus) and imaging review (Radiology).
- Compile inputs and ask ReportCreation to produce the Word tumor-board report.
Plan, sequence, and participants
- Order of participation (intended): PatientHistory -> PatientStatus -> Radiology -> ReportCreation. ClinicalTrials / ClinicalGuidelines / MedicalResearch may be queried afterward if you request those add-ons.
- What each agent will need:
  - PatientHistory: requires the patient ID as a string (you provided "patient_4"); it will retrieve timeline, demographics, biomarkers, pathology, staging, treatment history, ECOG, imaging references, social history, and assemble the required JSON output.
  - PatientStatus: needs age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG (to be provided by PatientHistory).
  - Radiology: needs imaging files (CT/PET/X-ray) or imaging references included in PatientHistory’s output to produce imaging findings/insights.
  - ReportCreation: needs the compiled patient timeline, clinical summary, medical/social history, cancer type, CT/x-ray findings, pathology, treatment plan (note: I will not ask ClinicalGuidelines to produce treatment recommendations unless you request them), and any clinical trial interests.
Special rule and procedural note
- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator) and conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator".
Immediate actions I propose
1) Validate patient ID (I have patient_id = "patient_4" which is a non-empty string) — valid.
2) Ask PatientHistory to retrieve the structured patient timeline and required clinical data for "patient_4".
3) After PatientHistory returns, I will call PatientStatus and Radiology (if imaging is available) and then hand the aggregated content to ReportCreation to generate the Word document.

Questions / items I need from you before proceeding
- User, please confirm you want me to proceed to retrieve records for patient_4 and generate the tumor-board Word report.
- User, do you have imaging files (CT/PET/X-ray) to upload now? If so, please upload them or confirm they are available in the patient's record.
- Any restrictions on including social history or sensitive notes in the tumor-board report?

Now I will initiate the first call.
PatientHistory, please confirm whether you have everything needed to retrieve a full structured timeline for patient_id "patient_4". If you do, please proceed to return the JSON per your schema (status, patient_id, patient_timeline array, history_summary, error_message=null) and include any imaging file references or filenames you find. Conclude your response with: "back to you: Orchestrator".

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Checklist — next moderation steps
- Ask the user to confirm inclusion of sensitive info and imaging attachments for the tumor-board Word report.
- Request PatientStatus to synthesize current patient status using PatientHistory data.
- Request Radiology to (a) analyze the supplied chest x‑ray image and (b) summarize the CT/PET imaging findings already in the timeline.
- After both agents return, aggregate outputs and send to ReportCreation to generate the formatted Word tumor‑board report.

Plan & sequence (brief)
- Order: PatientStatus -> Radiology -> ReportCreation.
- Each agent will receive the exact inputs they need from PatientHistory. Each agent must conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator".

User question before I proceed
- User, please confirm you want me to proceed to generate the tumor-board Word report for patient_4 including the full timeline and imaging. Specifically:
  1) May I include all diagnostic notes, imaging findings, biomarkers, treatment history, and the oncologic plan as presented in the records? (yes/no)
  2) Do you want the chest x-ray image (x-ray.png) embedded in the Word document? (yes/no)
  3) Any restrictions on including social history or other sensitive notes? If yes, specify what to omit.
  4) Preferred filename for the Word document (default: "patient_4_tumor_board_report.docx").

After you confirm, I will call the agents below.

PatientStatus, please proceed
- Inputs (from PatientHistory for patient_id "patient_4"):
  - Age: 59
  - Stage at diagnosis / current staging: T4 N3 M1a (Stage IVA)
  - Primary site: Left lung — lingula
  - Histology: Adenocarcinoma (metastatic NSCLC)
  - Biomarkers: KRAS p.G12C; PD-L1 negative
  - Treatment history: Induction carboplatin + paclitaxel + pembrolizumab (6 cycles completed 2020-09-24); maintenance pembrolizumab started 2020-12-28 and continued until progression (discontinued after progression noted 2021-03-22); planned KRAS-directed therapy discussion (adagrasib) per notes
  - ECOG: 1
- Request: Produce a concise "current patient status" summary suitable for inclusion in a tumor-board slide (include ECOG, active comorbidities noted [hypothyroidism on levothyroxine, CAD], and short one-line statement of disease status as of latest imaging). Return structured output (concise bullet-style) and conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator".

Radiology, please proceed
- Inputs:
  - Image: x-ray.png (URL: https://stapphaolmatevx.blob.core.windows.net/patient-data/patient_4/images/x-ray.png)
  - Imaging report excerpts / timeline to summarize:
    - 2020-03-07: Baseline PET/CT — hypermetabolic lingular mass ~3.4 x 3.8 cm; mediastinal nodes; 8 mm RLL nodule; left supraclavicular node
    - 2020-08-03: Interim PET/CT — partial metabolic response of primary and nodes
    - 2020-10-22: PET/CT — lingular nodule 27 x 22 mm, SUV 6.9 (improved)
    - 2021-02-15: Chest CT — lingular mass increased to 3.6 x 2.5 cm; LLL nodule increased to 10 x 4 mm
    - 2021-03-22: PET/CT — interval progression: 4.1 cm left lung mass, new/increased left hilar/infrahilar nodes
- Requests:
  1) Analyze the provided chest x-ray image and report clear findings (e.g., focal consolidation/mass, effusion, cardiomediastinal silhouette, hardware) and state image quality/limitations.
  2) Provide a concise synthesis of the CT/PET imaging timeline above into a short radiology impression suitable for a tumor-board slide (1–3 lines), highlighting dates and progression vs. response.
  3) If the x-ray adds no new actionable detail compared with prior CT/PET, state that explicitly.
- Conclude the response with: "back to you: Orchestrator".

Next step after agent outputs
- I will summarize each agent’s contribution in 1–2 sentences (milestone update), then ask ReportCreation to produce the Word document incorporating (a) patient timeline, (b) clinical summary from PatientStatus, (c) radiology impressions, (d) pathology/biomarkers, and (e) any imaging files you approved for embedding.
- Reminder: I will NOT provide clinical treatment recommendations — only compile the diagnostic summary and imaging for tumor-board presentation.

Please confirm the four user items above so I can proceed to call PatientStatus and Radiology.
