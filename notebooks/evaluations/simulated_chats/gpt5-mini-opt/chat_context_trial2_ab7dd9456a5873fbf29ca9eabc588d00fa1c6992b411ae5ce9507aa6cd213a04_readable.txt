Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Checklist — planned moderation steps
- Confirm the provided patient ID is present and valid.
- Request the patient timeline/history from PatientHistory.
- Gather imaging and clinical details (via Radiology and PatientStatus) as needed.
- Coordinate downstream tasks (ClinicalTrials, ClinicalGuidelines, ReportCreation, MedicalResearch) once status and imaging are available.
- Provide milestone updates after each agent responds and summarize at the end.

Planned sequence and purpose
1. PatientHistory — retrieve structured timeline and concise history for patient_4 (required first).
2. Radiology — analyze any uploaded imaging (needs images).
3. PatientStatus — produce current patient status using PatientHistory output.
4. ClinicalTrials — identify suitable trials based on patient status.
5. ClinicalGuidelines — outline applicable guideline-based considerations (note: I will not request or provide clinical recommendations).
6. ReportCreation — prepare a tumor-board Word document using assembled information.
7. MedicalResearch — provide background literature if requested (needs a topic/keyword).

Special rule to all agents and participants
> Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

Validation of patient ID
- I have received: patient ID = "patient_4" (string). This is valid and I will proceed.

User requests / required uploads
User, please confirm you want me to prepare a tumor-board packet for patient_4. Also please upload or indicate availability of:
- Imaging (CT scans, chest x-ray, PET) and any image files, or indicate there are none.
- Pathology report(s) and relevant biomarker results, if available.
- Any additional documents you want included (clinic notes, prior treatment summaries).

Planned immediate action
- PatientHistory, please proceed with retrieving the structured timeline and concise history for patient ID "patient_4". Follow your workflow: validate the patient ID, retrieve timeline data, return status, patient_id, patient_timeline (array), history_summary, and error_message=null on success — or status:error with an explanatory error_message if invalid/missing. If you need additional inputs to locate the record, state what you need. After your response, conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

User, do you confirm this plan and will you provide imaging/pathology if available? If yes, I will request PatientHistory now.
