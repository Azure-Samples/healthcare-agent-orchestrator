This is required before other agents proceed.\\n2) Radiology \u2014 analyze imaging findings (CT/X-ray) once imaging or imaging reports are available from PatientHistory (or from the user).\\n3) PatientStatus \u2014 produce current patient status (age, stage, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG) using PatientHistory output.\\n4) ClinicalTrials (optional) \u2014 identify relevant trial options using PatientStatus.\\n5) ReportCreation \u2014 produce the formatted Word document for tumor board using all collected inputs.\\n(ClinicalGuidelines and MedicalResearch can be engaged if the user requests guideline summaries or literature searches; they will need PatientStatus or a topic.)\\n\\nSpecial rule to include in the plan\\n- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent should conclude their response with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nNext steps and clarifying requests\\n- User, please confirm that you want me to proceed with this sequence for Patient ID \\\"patient_4\\\".\\n- User, do you have any imaging files (CT scans, chest x-rays) or pathology reports to upload now? Radiology will need images or the imaging report text to analyze; if you cannot provide images, PatientHistory should include the imaging report text in their response.\\n\\nPatientHistory, please proceed\\n- PatientHistory, validate that patient_id is a non-empty string. For patient_id \\\"patient_4\\\", retrieve the patient timeline events, biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, pathology details, imaging reports (CT/x-ray descriptions), age, primary site, histology, ECOG performance status, and any social/medical history items relevant for a tumor-board summary.\\n- Follow your workflow: return a JSON with status \\\"success\\\", patient_id, patient_timeline (array of events), history_summary (concise), and error_message null. If the ID is invalid, return status \\\"error\\\" and an explanatory error_message.\\n- Please include imaging report texts (CT/X-ray) if you have them. If you do not have images, state that clearly.\\n- Conclude your response with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nMicro-update after PatientHistory responds\\n- I will provide a 1\u20132 sentence update summarizing what was received and then request Radiology and PatientStatus to proceed as appropriate.\\n\\nPlease confirm from the user whether to proceed now with PatientHistory. If yes, I will prompt PatientHistory to begin.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
