USER:
Generate a comprehensive diagnostic summary for Patient ID: patient_4 including biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, and latest imaging findings. Export the report as a formatted Word document for tumor board presentation.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Checklist — my planned moderation steps
- Validate the provided patient ID and confirm any missing user inputs (images, reports).
- Ask PatientHistory to retrieve and return a structured timeline and concise history summary for patient_4.
- Use PatientHistory output to sequence PatientStatus, Radiology, ClinicalTrials (if needed), and ReportCreation to produce the tumor-board Word document.
- After each agent response, collect required additional details and provide a brief 1–2 sentence micro-update before moving to the next agent.
- Ensure each agent yields the chat back to me and concludes with: "back to you: Orchestrator".

Plan and sequence (expected participation order)
1. PatientHistory — retrieve and deliver a validated JSON timeline and concise history_summary for patient_4. (Required first step; PatientStatus, Radiology and ReportCreation depend on this.)
2. PatientStatus — synthesize current status (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).
3. Radiology — provide imaging insights using imaging files or imaging report text supplied by PatientHistory (or by the user if available).
4. ClinicalTrials — (if requested/needed) provide trial options based on the patient’s current status.
5. ReportCreation — compile a formatted Word document suitable for tumor board presentation using the timeline, clinical summary, imaging and pathology findings, and (if requested) clinical trials. 

Special rule to be followed in every agent response
- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent must conclude their message with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

User confirmation and initial requirements
- User, I will proceed only after confirming the patient ID is valid. You provided: patient_4 — please confirm this is correct.
- User, do you have any imaging files (DICOM, CT/PET/JPEG image files) or the raw imaging reports for patient_4 to include? If yes, please upload them now or paste the report text. Radiology may request images for image-level review; otherwise Radiology can interpret image report text.
- If there are privacy or PHI constraints, please confirm you have permission to share these records.

Now I will invoke PatientHistory to retrieve the requested timeline and structured summary.

PatientHistory, please proceed with the following:
- Validate that the provided patient ID is present and is a string.
- Retrieve the relevant patient timeline data for patient_4 (clinic notes, pathology, biomarker status, staging at diagnosis, treatment history, and latest imaging reports/findings).
- Return a JSON response exactly matching your required schema:
  - For success: include "status": "success", "patient_id": "patient_4", a structured array "patient_timeline" of events (date, event_type, brief details), a concise "history_summary", and "error_message": null.
  - For error (e.g., missing/invalid ID or no data found): include "status": "error" and a meaningful "error_message".
- If imaging files are available in the record, include references or attach report text; if images themselves are available, indicate how they can be accessed.
- Conclude your response with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

Micro-update (what will happen after PatientHistory responds)
- I will review PatientHistory's JSON for completeness. If any items are missing (age, staging, biomarkers, ECOG, or imaging files), I will request them from either you (the User) or PatientHistory before proceeding to PatientStatus and Radiology.

Please confirm that patient_4 is correct and upload any imaging files or imaging report text now if available. Once confirmed, PatientHistory — please proceed.
