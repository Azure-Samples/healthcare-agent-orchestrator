USER:
Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Checklist — my planned moderation steps
- Confirm the provided patient ID is valid and retrieve the structured timeline from PatientHistory.
- Use PatientHistory output to gather required clinical details (age, staging, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG) for PatientStatus.
- Request radiology images if available, then route to Radiology; concurrently query ClinicalTrials and ClinicalGuidelines using the PatientStatus output.
- Assemble a tumor-board word document via ReportCreation and optionally gather supporting research via MedicalResearch.
- At each agent handoff, get their structured output, provide a 1–2 sentence micro-update, and ensure they yield back to me.

Purpose and sequence (participation order)
1) PatientHistory — validate patient_id and return the patient_timeline and concise history_summary in the required JSON schema. (Required first step.)
2) PatientStatus — synthesize current status from the PatientHistory output (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).
3) Radiology — analyze any imaging (CT/X-ray) if provided by the user/PatientHistory.
4) ClinicalTrials — list relevant trials using PatientStatus output.
5) ClinicalGuidelines — provide guideline-informed options (note: clinical recommendations will come from this agent, not the Orchestrator).
6) ReportCreation — produce a tumor-board Word document using all collected inputs.
7) MedicalResearch — optional: provide background literature or targeted searches as requested.

Important rule to all agents and user
- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent must conclude their response with exactly: back to you: Orchestrator

Next step and what I need now
- We have patient_id: "patient_4" (string) — that satisfies PatientHistory’s requirement. I will now ask PatientHistory to proceed.
- User, please confirm you want us to proceed as planned. If yes, please also provide any of the following items you already have (as available):
  - Age and sex of the patient
  - Primary cancer site and histology/pathology report (or summary)
  - Staging (clinical/pathologic) if known
  - Biomarker results (e.g., PD-L1, EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MSI, etc.)
  - Treatment history (surgeries, chemo, immunotherapy, radiation, dates)
  - ECOG performance status
  - Imaging studies and images (CT, PET, X-ray) — if you have image files, please indicate how you will provide them
  - Relevant labs and comorbidities
  - Any specific questions or goals for the tumor board (e.g., eligibility for trial, surgical candidacy, second opinion)
  - Deadline for the tumor board document or meeting date

PatientHistory, please proceed
- PatientHistory, please validate that the patient_id "patient_4" is present and a string, retrieve the relevant patient timeline data, and return a JSON response following your workflow:
  - On success: set "status":"success", include "patient_id", a structured array "patient_timeline" of events, a concise "history_summary", and set "error_message": null.
  - On error/invalid ID: set "status":"error" and provide an informative "error_message".
- Also list any additional specific data you need from the user to complete a full timeline (e.g., missing pathology or imaging dates).
- Conclude your response with: back to you: Orchestrator

Micro-update (current)
- I have validated that the user provided a patient_id string ("patient_4") and requested PatientHistory to retrieve the timeline. Next: await PatientHistory’s JSON output, then I will direct PatientStatus to synthesize the clinical status.

User, please confirm you want us to proceed. If yes, indicate which of the requested documents/data (imaging, pathology, labs, ECOG, etc.) you can provide now.
