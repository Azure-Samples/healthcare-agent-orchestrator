USER:
Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Checklist — planned moderation steps
- Validate the patient ID and confirm required baseline data is available.
- Query PatientHistory to retrieve a structured timeline and concise summary.
- Sequence the specialist agents (Radiology → PatientStatus → ClinicalTrials / ClinicalGuidelines / MedicalResearch → ReportCreation) and collect their inputs.
- Produce milestone micro-updates after each agent response and ensure each agent yields control back to me.
- Deliver a final brief summary and ask the user if they want additional support or a revised plan.

Plan and participation order
- We will proceed in this order:
  1. PatientHistory (retrieve timeline for patient_4)
  2. Radiology (if imaging is available)
  3. PatientStatus (compile current status using PatientHistory data)
  4. ClinicalTrials and ClinicalGuidelines (require PatientStatus)
  5. MedicalResearch (optional topic-specific literature)
  6. ReportCreation (assemble the tumor-board Word document)
- Special rule to follow: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

Patient ID validation
- Received patient ID: "patient_4" — this is present and a string. We will proceed.

Requests to agents (please respond in order and finish with the required closing)
1) PatientHistory — please proceed
- PatientHistory, please retrieve and return a structured patient timeline for patient_id "patient_4" following your workflow: validate the ID, gather timeline events, and provide a concise history_summary. If any required records are missing to complete this (e.g., chart location, date ranges, specific notes), state what you need from the user. Format your response as: status, patient_id, patient_timeline (array of events), history_summary, error_message (null on success).
- After your response, conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator

Micro-update (after PatientHistory responds)
- I will provide a 1–2 sentence progress update summarizing what was returned and what the next agent needs.

2) Radiology — preparatory request
- Radiology, please state what you need to analyze imaging for patient_4 (file types, modalities such as CT or chest x-ray, DICOM/PDF, date of imaging) and whether you can work from imaging reports alone if raw images are not available. Do not proceed until PatientHistory provides imaging references or the user uploads images.
- After your response, conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator

3) PatientStatus — preparatory request
- PatientStatus, please list the exact data fields you require from PatientHistory to compute the patient's current status (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG performance status, etc.). Wait for PatientHistory output.
- After your response, conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator

4) ClinicalTrials and ClinicalGuidelines — preparatory request
- ClinicalTrials and ClinicalGuidelines, each please confirm you will wait for PatientStatus output. Also list any specific format or fields you need from PatientStatus to provide trial options or guideline-aligned plans (e.g., molecular profile, prior lines of therapy, performance status).
- After your response, conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator

5) MedicalResearch — preparatory request
- MedicalResearch, indicate what keyword(s) or topic(s) you will search once we have a suspected cancer type or treatment question (e.g., "EGFR-mutant NSCLC targeted therapy"). Ask if you should automatically search for latest trials, meta-analyses, or practice-changing papers.
- After your response, conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator

6) ReportCreation — preparatory request
- ReportCreation, list the items you need to produce a tumor-board Word document (patient timeline, clinical summary, medical/social history, cancer type, CT/x-ray findings, pathology, treatment plan, clinical trials, recommended discussion points). State your preferred delivery format (file or pasteable text) and any constraints.
- After your response, conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator

User action items (User, please provide)
- Please confirm you agree with the above plan and order.
- Please upload or paste any of the following for patient_4 if available:
  - Recent imaging (DICOM/CT, chest x-ray) or radiology reports and dates
  - Pathology report(s) including histology and biomarkers
  - Age, staging, primary tumor site
  - Prior treatment history (agents, dates, responses)
  - ECOG performance status
  - Relevant labs or clinical notes
  - Social history or other items you want included in the tumor-board packet
  - Preferred date/time for the tumor board and preferred file format for the Word document
- If there are any PHI or sharing restrictions, please state them now.

Next step (pending your confirmation)
- Once you confirm and/or provide files, I will ask PatientHistory to retrieve the timeline for patient_4. If you approve, I will now call PatientHistory to proceed.

Please confirm you want us to proceed as above, and attach any available documents for patient_4.
