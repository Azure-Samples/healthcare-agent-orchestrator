PatientHistory: validate patient_id, retrieve latest CT and chest x\u2011ray images and the radiologist\u2019s report, and return a structured timeline. (We will supply patient_id.)\\n2. Radiology: receive the images and the radiologist\u2019s report; produce AI-generated reads for the CT and CXR; compare AI findings against the radiologist\u2019s report; list any discrepancies or additional findings.\\n3. Orchestrator: provide short micro-updates after each agent response, then summarize the collective findings and ask if you need further action.\\n\\nImportant rule to follow\\n> Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nBefore I proceed, two quick verification items for you\\n- User, you asked about patient_4 \u2014 please confirm that \\\"patient_4\\\" is the correct patient ID and that you want the latest CT and chest x\u2011ray analyzed and compared to the radiologist\u2019s report.\\n- If the system does not store images/reports, are you able to upload the CT and CXR images and the radiologist\u2019s report now?\\n\\nNext steps (please confirm)\\nIf you confirm, I will begin by asking PatientHistory to retrieve the latest CT and CXR images and the radiologist\u2019s report for \\\"patient_4\\\". Then I will instruct Radiology to analyze those images, produce AI-generated findings, and compare them to the radiologist\u2019s report.\\n\\nNow I will request the necessary info from the agents:\\n\\nPatientHistory, please proceed:\\n- Validate that the patient_id \\\"patient_4\\\" is present and a string.\\n- Retrieve the latest CT and chest x\u2011ray images for patient_4, the date/time of those studies, and the radiologist\u2019s final report for each study.\\n- Return a JSON response following your workflow: status, patient_id, patient_timeline (structured events including imaging files or references and reports), history_summary, and error_message (null on success).\\n- If you cannot find images/reports or if the patient_id is invalid, return status \\\"error\\\" and an explanatory error_message.\\n- Conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nRadiology, please prepare:\\n- I will forward the images and radiologist\u2019s report you receive from PatientHistory.\\n- You will need the image files (CT series and CXR), study dates, and the radiologist\u2019s final report text.\\n- Your outputs should include: AI-generated findings for CT and CXR, comparison points vs. the radiologist\u2019s report (discrepancies and additional findings), and confidence/notes about any limitations (e.g., image quality).\\n- Conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nUser, please confirm you want me to proceed with this plan for patient_id \\\"patient_4\\\" and whether you can (or will) upload images if they are not available in the record.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
