USER:
Identify and list active clinical trials that patient_4 is eligible for, based on tumor type, stage, KRAS mutation status, treatment history, and geographic location. Include trial phase and contact info.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Checklist — my planned moderation steps
- Confirm required patient identifier and any missing user details (geography, distance).
- Request a structured patient timeline from PatientHistory and validate it.
- Use PatientHistory output to request PatientStatus, then pass that to ClinicalTrials to identify eligible trials.
- Present findings to you, summarise progress at each step, and ensure all agents yield back to me.

Plan and sequence
- Purpose: Identify active clinical trials patient_4 may be eligible for given tumor type, stage, KRAS status, treatment history, and location.
- Participation order:
  1. PatientHistory — retrieve/validate patient_4 timeline and key clinical data (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).
  2. PatientStatus — produce current patient status using PatientHistory output.
  3. ClinicalTrials — search and list active trials matching the PatientStatus and geographic constraints (include phase and contact info).
- Each agent, after completing their task, must conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

User question for clarification
- User, can you provide the geographic location to search for trials (country and city or ZIP/postal code)? Also let me know if you want a maximum travel radius (e.g., 50 miles / 80 km). If you prefer national-only or international, say so.

Now I'll proceed to retrieve the patient timeline.
- PatientHistory, please validate that the patient ID "patient_4" is present and a string, then retrieve and return the structured patient_timeline and concise history_summary for patient_4 following your required JSON schema (set "status" to "success" for a valid response). Include age, primary tumor site, histology, stage, biomarkers (KRAS status highlighted), treatment history, and ECOG if available. If the patient ID is invalid or missing, return the error schema required. Conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

Micro-update: once PatientHistory responds, I'll validate the JSON and then request PatientStatus.
