USER:
Given the presence of a KRAS p.G12C mutation, what are the potential benefits and risks of transitioning to KRAS-directed treatment with adagrasib? How might this change the patient's prognosis?

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation checklist
- Collect the required patient identifier and any missing clinical details.
- Retrieve the patient timeline and build a concise clinical summary.
- Derive current patient status (staging, performance, prior treatments).
- Ask guideline- and research-focused agents to provide an evidence-based overview of benefits, risks, and prognosis implications for adagrasib.
- Return a short, consolidated summary and ask whether to proceed to trial matching / report generation.

Planned sequence and roles (what will happen next)
1) PatientHistory — will fetch the patient timeline and history. I need a patient ID string from you to proceed.  
2) PatientStatus — will use the history to produce current status (age, stage, primary site, histology, biomarkers, prior treatments, ECOG).  
3) ClinicalGuidelines — will provide an evidence-based discussion of potential benefits and risks of KRAS G12C–directed therapy with adagrasib and how it might affect prognosis (note: ClinicalGuidelines can discuss general guidance and evidence; I will not give direct treatment recommendations).  
4) MedicalResearch — will supply trial results and literature supporting the benefit/risk statements (e.g., KRYSTAL-1 results).  
5) ClinicalTrials (optional) — if you want, this agent can look for relevant active trials given the patient’s status.  
6) Radiology / ReportCreation (optional) — included only if you want imaging review or a tumor-board style document.

Special rule (applies to all agents)
- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator) and conclude their reply with: "back to you: Orchestrator".

What I need from you now (User)
- User, please provide the patient ID as a string (required). If you do not have a patient ID, say so and indicate whether you want a general, non–patient-specific overview.  
- If you want a personalized response but cannot provide a patient ID, please supply these key details instead: diagnosis (cancer type), stage, age, histology, prior treatments, ECOG performance status, and whether KRAS p.G12C is the only actionable mutation.

PatientHistory, please confirm what you require to proceed (e.g., exact patient ID string and any preferred date range or notes) and whether you need any additional inputs. Conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator".

User, please confirm you want me to proceed with that plan and provide the patient ID (or say you prefer a general overview).
