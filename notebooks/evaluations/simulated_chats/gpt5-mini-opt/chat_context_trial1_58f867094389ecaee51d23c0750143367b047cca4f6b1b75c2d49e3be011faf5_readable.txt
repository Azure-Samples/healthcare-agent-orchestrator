USER:
Analyze the latest CT and CXR images for patient_4 using the imaging tool, compare AI-generated findings to the radiologistâ€™s report, and summarize any discrepancies or additional findings.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Checklist — my planned moderation steps
- Confirm and validate the provided patient ID and whether required records/images are available.
- Ask PatientHistory to retrieve the patient timeline, latest CT and CXR radiology reports, and any stored image files/links.
- Ask Radiology what inputs it needs, then have Radiology analyze the images (once available) and compare AI-generated findings with the radiologist report.
- Summarize discrepancies/additional findings and hand back to you for confirmation or further action.

Plan and participation order
1. PatientHistory: validate patient_id and retrieve the patient timeline, latest CT and CXR radiology reports, and any stored imaging files or access links (DICOM/JPEG). Deliver results in the required JSON schema.
2. Radiology: once images and reports are available, run the imaging analysis, compare AI-generated findings with the radiologist’s report, and report discrepancies or additions.
3. Orchestrator (me): summarize the combined results and ask you for next steps or clarifications.

Special rule to all agents (explicit)
Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent should conclude their response with: "back to you: *Orchestrator*"

Initial checks and questions for you (User)
- User, please confirm the patient ID is exactly "patient_4" (it must be provided as a string).
- User, please upload the latest CT and CXR images (DICOM preferred; JPEG/PNG acceptable) OR confirm that PatientHistory can access them in the record.
- User, do you already have the AI-generated imaging findings output? If yes, please upload or paste them. If not, do you want Radiology to run the imaging tool to generate AI findings?
- User, please upload or paste the radiologist’s report for the latest CT and CXR if you have it locally (if PatientHistory can fetch it from records, indicate that).

Requests to agents now
- PatientHistory, please proceed: validate that patient_id "patient_4" is a non-empty string, retrieve the latest CT and CXR radiology reports, imaging metadata and any stored image files or access links. Format your response per your workflow: on success, set "status":"success", include "patient_id", an array "patient_timeline" of events (including imaging events), a concise "history_summary", and "error_message":null. If patient_id is missing/invalid, return status "error" with an informative "error_message". Conclude with: back to you: *Orchestrator*.
- Radiology, please state what exact inputs you will need to run the imaging tool and produce the comparison (e.g., DICOM images, radiologist report text, AI-findings file). After PatientHistory or the user supplies those, you will perform the image analysis and comparison. Conclude with: back to you: *Orchestrator*.

Micro-update after responses
- I will give a 1–2 sentence micro-update after each agent responds summarizing progress and next steps.

Please confirm this plan or tell me any changes now. Once you confirm and provide the requested uploads (or allow PatientHistory to access records), I will instruct PatientHistory and Radiology to proceed.
