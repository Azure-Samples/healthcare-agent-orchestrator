USER:
Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Checklist — my planned moderation steps
- Confirm the patient ID and validate input format.
- Request the structured patient timeline from PatientHistory.
- Gather missing clinical data (imaging, pathology, biomarkers, staging, ECOG, treatment history) from the user as needed.
- Sequence agents: PatientHistory → PatientStatus → Radiology (if images provided) → ClinicalTrials / ClinicalGuidelines → ReportCreation → MedicalResearch (optional).
- Provide milestone micro-updates after each agent response and ensure each agent yields back to me.

Planned sequence and purpose
- I will first ask PatientHistory to retrieve and validate the timeline for patient_4.
- Next, PatientStatus will synthesize the current clinical status using that timeline.
- If imaging is available, Radiology will analyze images (I will request images from you or PatientHistory).
- ClinicalTrials and ClinicalGuidelines will use PatientStatus output to provide trial options and guideline-based information (note: these are informational only; no treatment recommendations will be made).
- ReportCreation will use all collected material to produce a tumor-board–ready document.
- MedicalResearch can be invoked last for topic-specific literature or evidence searches if requested.

Special rule (applies to all agents)
- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent must conclude their message with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

Next actions — immediate requests
1) PatientHistory, please proceed:
- Validate the patient ID "patient_4" (confirm it is present and a string).
- Retrieve the patient timeline and produce output that matches the required JSON schema:
  - status: "success" or "error"
  - patient_id
  - patient_timeline: array of structured events (date, event_type, brief details)
  - history_summary: concise summary (1–3 lines)
  - error_message: null if success, informative string if error
- If you encounter validation problems or missing data, return status "error" with an explanatory error_message.
- Conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

2) User, please confirm:
- Do you confirm I should proceed requesting the patient timeline from PatientHistory for patient_4?
- Please provide any of the following documents now if available (these will speed Radiology, PatientStatus, and ReportCreation):
  - Imaging files (CT/PET/MRI/x-rays) or links
  - Pathology report and biomarker results (e.g., PD-L1, molecular panel)
  - Current staging, histology, age, ECOG performance status
  - Treatment history (surgery, chemo, radiation, systemic agents) and dates
  - Relevant social history or comorbidities
If you do not have these now, we will proceed initially with the PatientHistory timeline and then request missing items as needed.

Please confirm you want me to proceed with PatientHistory now, and provide any of the documents above if available.
