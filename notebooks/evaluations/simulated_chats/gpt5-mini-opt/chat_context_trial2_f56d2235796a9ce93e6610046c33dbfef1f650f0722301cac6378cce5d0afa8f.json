(Required first step.)\\n2) PatientStatus \u2014 synthesize current status from the PatientHistory output (age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).\\n3) Radiology \u2014 analyze any imaging (CT/X-ray) if provided by the user/PatientHistory.\\n4) ClinicalTrials \u2014 list relevant trials using PatientStatus output.\\n5) ClinicalGuidelines \u2014 provide guideline-informed options (note: clinical recommendations will come from this agent, not the Orchestrator).\\n6) ReportCreation \u2014 produce a tumor-board Word document using all collected inputs.\\n7) MedicalResearch \u2014 optional: provide background literature or targeted searches as requested.\\n\\nImportant rule to all agents and user\\n- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent must conclude their response with exactly: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nNext step and what I need now\\n- We have patient_id: \\\"patient_4\\\" (string) \u2014 that satisfies PatientHistory\u2019s requirement. I will now ask PatientHistory to proceed.\\n- User, please confirm you want us to proceed as planned. If yes, please also provide any of the following items you already have (as available):\\n  - Age and sex of the patient\\n  - Primary cancer site and histology/pathology report (or summary)\\n  - Staging (clinical/pathologic) if known\\n  - Biomarker results (e.g., PD-L1, EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MSI, etc.)\\n  - Treatment history (surgeries, chemo, immunotherapy, radiation, dates)\\n  - ECOG performance status\\n  - Imaging studies and images (CT, PET, X-ray) \u2014 if you have image files, please indicate how you will provide them\\n  - Relevant labs and comorbidities\\n  - Any specific questions or goals for the tumor board (e.g., eligibility for trial, surgical candidacy, second opinion)\\n  - Deadline for the tumor board document or meeting date\\n\\nPatientHistory, please proceed\\n- PatientHistory, please validate that the patient_id \\\"patient_4\\\" is present and a string, retrieve the relevant patient timeline data, and return a JSON response following your workflow:\\n  - On success: set \\\"status\\\":\\\"success\\\", include \\\"patient_id\\\", a structured array \\\"patient_timeline\\\" of events, a concise \\\"history_summary\\\", and set \\\"error_message\\\": null.\\n  - On error/invalid ID: set \\\"status\\\":\\\"error\\\" and provide an informative \\\"error_message\\\".\\n- Also list any additional specific data you need from the user to complete a full timeline (e.g., missing pathology or imaging dates).\\n- Conclude your response with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nMicro-update (current)\\n- I have validated that the user provided a patient_id string (\\\"patient_4\\\") and requested PatientHistory to retrieve the timeline. Next: await PatientHistory\u2019s JSON output, then I will direct PatientStatus to synthesize the clinical status.\\n\\nUser, please confirm you want us to proceed. If yes, indicate which of the requested documents/data (imaging, pathology, labs, ECOG, etc.) you can provide now.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
