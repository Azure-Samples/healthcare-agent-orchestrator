USER:
Given the KRAS p.G12C mutation in patient_4, summarize current treatment options including KRAS inhibitors, chemo-immunotherapy, and emerging trial drugs. Include efficacy, risk profile, and how this may affect prognosis

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Checklist — my planned moderation steps
- Confirm we have a valid patient ID and request the patient's timeline/history from PatientHistory.
- Gather missing clinical details (age, primary site, stage, histology, biomarkers, prior treatments, ECOG) from PatientHistory or the user.
- Route the consolidated status to PatientStatus, then to ClinicalGuidelines, ClinicalTrials, and MedicalResearch for informational summaries (efficacy, risks, prognosis, and trials).
- Deliver concise micro-updates after each agent reply and finish with a 1–2 sentence collective summary and next-step options.

Planned sequence and participation order
1. PatientHistory — retrieve/produce patient_4 timeline and summary (required).
2. PatientStatus — produce current status (needs PatientHistory outputs).
3. ClinicalGuidelines — provide guideline-informed, non-prescriptive informational summary of relevant treatment classes (needs PatientStatus).
4. ClinicalTrials — list relevant ongoing/combinatorial trial strategies for KRAS G12C (needs PatientStatus).
5. MedicalResearch — provide short research context on emerging agents and mechanisms (needs keywords/topic derived from earlier steps).
Note: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent should conclude their reply with: back to you: Orchestrator

Initial action — validating patient ID and requesting history
- The user provided: patient_4 (string). That is a valid patient ID string. Next I will request PatientHistory to retrieve the timeline and a concise history summary for patient_4.

PatientHistory, please proceed with the workflow:
- Validate patient_id = "patient_4" (string).
- Retrieve relevant timeline data and produce a JSON response following your required schema. For success, include:
  - status: "success"
  - patient_id: "patient_4"
  - patient_timeline: an array of events (date, event type, concise details)
  - history_summary: concise summary
  - error_message: null
- If you cannot retrieve notes or data, return status "error" and an informative error_message explaining what is missing and list which specific data elements you need from the user (age, primary tumor site, stage, histology, biomarkers including PD-L1, prior systemic therapies and lines, ECOG).
- Conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator

User, while PatientHistory retrieves the record (or requests missing details), please confirm or provide the following if available for patient_4:
- Age
- Primary cancer site (e.g., non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal, other)
- Current stage
- Histology (e.g., adenocarcinoma)
- Biomarkers beyond KRAS p.G12C (e.g., PD-L1 TPS, EGFR, ALK, BRAF, MSI status)
- Prior treatments and lines (chemo, immunotherapy, targeted agents)
- ECOG performance status

Do you confirm proceeding as above? If yes, PatientHistory will begin. If some of the requested details are not available, please state that and PatientHistory will indicate what it needs.
