PatientHistory \u2014 retrieve and return the latest CT and CXR images and the radiologist's reports for patient_4 (per their required JSON schema).\\n2. Radiology \u2014 run the imaging tool analysis on those images, produce AI-generated findings, and compare to the radiologist\u2019s report.\\n3. Orchestrator (me) \u2014 summarize discrepancies/additional findings, provide short micro-updates after each agent, and check with you about next steps.\\n\\nSpecial rule to all agents: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nUser, please confirm that you want me to proceed with this plan for patient_4. If yes, I will instruct PatientHistory to retrieve the imaging files and associated radiologist reports.\\n\\nPatientHistory, please proceed:\\n- Required input: patient_id as a string. I will provide \\\"patient_4\\\".\\n- Please return a validated response per your workflow: include \\\"status\\\", \\\"patient_id\\\", a structured array \\\"patient_timeline\\\" with events (including links/identifiers for the latest CT and CXR images and the radiologist's report text), a concise \\\"history_summary\\\", and \\\"error_message\\\": null on success. If you need additional details beyond the patient_id, please specify them now.\\n- Conclude your response with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nIf you have any other constraints or specific image formats we should expect, User, please tell me now. Otherwise, confirm and I will instruct PatientHistory to fetch the data.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
