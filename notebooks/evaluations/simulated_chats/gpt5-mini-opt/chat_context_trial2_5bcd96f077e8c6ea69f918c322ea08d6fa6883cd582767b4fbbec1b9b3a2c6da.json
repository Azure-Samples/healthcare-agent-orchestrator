PatientHistory \u2014 retrieve and summarize the patient's timeline, biomarkers, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, latest imaging reports (and provide structured JSON per spec).\\n2. PatientStatus \u2014 derive current status (requires PatientHistory outputs: age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).\\n3. Radiology \u2014 analyze images or imaging reports (needs images or imaging reports from PatientHistory or from the user).\\n4. ClinicalTrials (optional) \u2014 identify potential trials based on PatientStatus if you request this.\\n5. ReportCreation \u2014 assemble a formatted Word document for tumor board using the collected timeline, clinical summary, imaging/pathology findings, and treatment history.\\nEach agent, after completing their task, must yield chat back to me (the Orchestrator) and conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nImmediate actions now\\n- PatientHistory, please proceed:\\n  - Validate that the patient ID is present and a string (patient_4).\\n  - Retrieve relevant patient timeline data and include: age, date of diagnosis, primary site, histology, stage at diagnosis, biomarker status (e.g., EGFR, ALK, PD-L1, others), ECOG performance status (if documented), full treatment history (dates, regimens, responses), and latest imaging reports/findings (CT, PET, X-ray text if available).\\n  - Return a JSON object per your workflow: status (\\\"success\\\" or \\\"error\\\"), patient_id, patient_timeline (array of events with dates and brief details), history_summary (concise), and error_message (null if success).\\n  - If imaging files are referenced but not available as images, include the imaging report text and indicate images are missing.\\n  - Conclude your message with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\nUser, I need a couple quick clarifications before we begin:\\n- Do you confirm the patient ID is patient_4? (If yes, I will ask PatientHistory to proceed.) \\n- Do you have any image files (CT, PET, chest x-ray) or pathology reports to upload now? Radiology can analyze images but needs the image files; if you don't have images, textual imaging reports are sufficient.\\n- Any formatting preferences for the Word tumor-board report? (e.g., institutional header, include imaging figures inline, anonymize patient identifiers, margin/page limits)\\n\\nPlease confirm the above and upload any files now if available. Once PatientHistory returns their structured output, I will instruct PatientStatus and Radiology on what they need to produce next.\\n\\nMicro-update: after PatientHistory responds, I will summarize the retrieved data and then request any missing items required by Radiology or ReportCreation.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
