Return the PatientHistory response using your required JSON schema (status, patient_id, patient_timeline array, history_summary, error_message=null on success) and include links or embedded references to the imaging files and the report text.

Also confirm any other inputs you require to run the imaging tool (e.g., which CT phase, whether contrast was used). After PatientHistory supplies images, you will run the AI analysis and provide your findings.
