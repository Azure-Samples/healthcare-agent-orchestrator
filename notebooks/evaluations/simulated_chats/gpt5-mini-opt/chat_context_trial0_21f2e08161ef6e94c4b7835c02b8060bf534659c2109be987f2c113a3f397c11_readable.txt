USER:
Based on the full clinical picture of patient_4â€”including stage, biomarkers, treatment response, and recent imagingâ€”generate a short report estimating prognosis and possible progression pathways.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Checklist — planned moderation steps
- Verify a valid patient ID string and request any missing imaging or reports from the user.
- Ask PatientHistory to retrieve the structured timeline and imaging reports for that patient ID.
- Use PatientStatus (based on PatientHistory output) and Radiology (if imaging available) to summarize current status and imaging interpretation.
- Consult MedicalResearch for prognosis data and typical progression pathways relevant to the patient’s profile.
- Return a concise, non-treatment prognosis/progression summary to the user.

Plan and participation order
1. PatientHistory — validate patient_id and provide the patient_timeline, history_summary, and imaging reports (if available). (Required first step.)
2. PatientStatus — synthesize current status (age, stage, site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).
3. Radiology — interpret the recent imaging (needs images or imaging report text from PatientHistory or the user).
4. MedicalResearch — provide literature-based prognosis ranges and typical progression pathways aligned to the patient status.
5. Orchestrator — compile a short report estimating prognosis and possible progression pathways (no treatment recommendations).

Special rule (applies to all agents)
Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator) and conclude their response with: back to you: Orchestrator

User confirmation and input needed
- User, please confirm the patient ID as the exact string "patient_4". If that is not correct, provide the exact patient ID string.
- User, if you have the recent imaging files (CT, chest x-ray) or the imaging report text, please upload or paste them now. Radiology can only analyze images or read report text supplied by PatientHistory or you.

Now proceeding to the first step
PatientHistory, please proceed to:
- Validate that the provided patient ID is the string "patient_4".
- Retrieve the patient timeline, recent imaging reports (or note if images are unavailable), staging, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, and ECOG if present in the record.
- Output according to your workflow: set "status" to "success" with "patient_id", "patient_timeline" (array of events), "history_summary" (concise), and "error_message": null. If the ID is missing or invalid, set "status" to "error" and include an explanatory "error_message".
- Indicate clearly whether any imaging files or reports are missing and what you need from the user.
Conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator
