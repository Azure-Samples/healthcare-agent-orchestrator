USER:
Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Checklist (what I'll do as moderator)
- Validate the provided patient ID and confirm next steps.
- Request the patient timeline from PatientHistory and gather any missing clinical details.
- Sequence the specialist agents (Radiology, PatientStatus, ClinicalTrials, ClinicalGuidelines, MedicalResearch, ReportCreation) to collect their inputs in order.
- Keep the user informed, ask for missing materials (images/reports), and obtain confirmation before proceeding.
- Ensure each agent returns control to me after their response and provide micro-updates after each agent's contribution.

Plan and sequence (overview and purpose)
- Purpose: Assemble a complete tumor-board package for patient_4 by collecting structured timeline, imaging interpretation, current clinical status, relevant trials/guidelines, and a tumor-board-ready report.
- Expected participation order:
  1. PatientHistory — retrieve patient timeline and core clinical data for patient_4.
  2. Radiology — review imaging (needs images or links; can accept imaging provided by PatientHistory).
  3. PatientStatus — synthesize current status (needs age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).
  4. ClinicalTrials — identify relevant trials (needs patient status from PatientStatus).
  5. ClinicalGuidelines — summarize guideline-based options (needs patient status from PatientStatus).
  6. MedicalResearch (optional) — provide research context or recent studies (needs keywords/topic).
  7. ReportCreation — compile a Word document for tumor board (needs timeline, summaries, imaging/path, trial options).
- Special rule to include here explicitly:
  Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to me (the Orchestrator). Each agent must conclude their response with: back to you: Orchestrator

Validation of input
- I confirm you provided a patient ID and it is a string: "patient_4" — valid. We may proceed.

Requests before I start
- PatientHistory, please proceed with retrieving the timeline for patient_id "patient_4". What specific details do you need from the user or records to complete the timeline retrieval? (PatientHistory: remember to validate that patient ID is present and a string; conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator)
- User, please provide any of the following if available (addressing you directly):
  - Imaging files or links (CT chest/abdomen/pelvis, PET-CT, chest x-ray) and dates.
  - Pathology report(s) including histology and molecular markers.
  - Current staging, ECOG performance status, age.
  - Complete treatment history (surgery, chemo, radiation, systemic agents and dates).
  - Any relevant labs or clinical notes.
  - If you do not have these, tell us which items are unavailable.

Micro-update and confirmation request
- After PatientHistory responds, I will give a 1–2 sentence micro-update and then call Radiology (if images are available) or PatientStatus next.
- Please confirm you agree with this plan and provide the items requested (or say "proceed" if you want us to fetch only the data PatientHistory can access).
