Include: age, primary site, histology, stage, KRAS mutation details (mutation type if available), full treatment history with dates, ECOG PS, and geographic location if recorded. If patient_id is missing/invalid, return an error per your schema. Conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator\\n\\n- User, while PatientHistory retrieves this: please confirm that \\\"patient_4\\\" is the correct patient_id (exact string) and provide the patient\u2019s geographic location (city, state/province, country) and any travel constraints (e.g., will not travel >50 miles). If you prefer nationwide trials only, say so.\\n\\nPlease confirm or correct the plan.
