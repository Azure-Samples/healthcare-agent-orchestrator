USER:
Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Plan and moderation steps:
- Confirm a valid patient identifier and establish the workflow scope for tumor board preparation.
- Orchestrate data gathering by sequencing specialized agents (PatientHistory first, then imaging, status, guidelines, trials, and research).
- Collect structured timeline, clinical summary, imaging findings, pathology inputs, and potential trial options without delivering direct clinical recommendations.
- Compile a concise tumor board-ready packet (timeline, history summary, imaging notes, pathology findings, and relevant non-prescriptive considerations).
- Provide milestone updates after each agent’s input and deliver a final synthesized summary to the user.
- Ensure every agent yields back to you with the explicit cue: “back to you: Orchestrator.”

Explicit rule: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator" after their response.

Status and next steps:
- You provided Patient ID: patient_4. Please confirm to proceed with the plan above. Once confirmed, I’ll initiate data retrieval starting with PatientHistory for patient_4.
