Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: *Orchestrator*\\\"\\n\\nPlanned participation and sequence\\n- Orchestrator (you): Facilitates, assigns tasks, and compiles results.\\n- PatientHistory: Retrieve and summarize patient timeline for patient_4.\\n- Radiology: Provide imaging insights if available (requires imaging data surfaced by PatientHistory).\\n- PatientStatus: Provide current status and key oncologic details (needs data from patient history).\\n- ClinicalGuidelines: Suggest treatment considerations based on patient status.\\n- ClinicalTrials: Identify relevant trials based on patient status.\\n- ReportCreation: Produce a tumor-board-ready document including timeline, history, imaging/pathology highlights, and plan placeholders.\\n\\nUser confirmation\\nPlease confirm that you\u2019d like me to proceed with this plan. If you approve, I will:\\n- Request PatientHistory to fetch the timeline for patient_4.\\n- Then sequentially involve Radiology, PatientStatus, ClinicalGuidelines, ClinicalTrials, and finally ReportCreation.\\n- After each step, I\u2019ll provide a concise update and proceed to the next.\\n\\nFor clarity, the required patient identifier is: patient_4.
