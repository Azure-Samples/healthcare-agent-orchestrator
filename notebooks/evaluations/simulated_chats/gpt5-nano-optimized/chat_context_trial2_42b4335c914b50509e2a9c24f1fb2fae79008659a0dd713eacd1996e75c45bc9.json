Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nNext action (pending your confirmation):\\n- If you approve, I will initiate data collection starting with PatientHistory for patient_4, followed by PatientStatus, Radiology, and then generate the Word document via ReportCreation. Please confirm to proceed. If you have any specific preferences for the document (e.g., formatting, level of detail, or sections to emphasize), share them now.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
