ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Moderation plan (concise, high-level):
- Confirm patient_id and scope, then coordinate data gathering across agents.
- Retrieve patient timeline and biomarker/stage/treatment history from PatientHistory.
- Obtain current imaging findings and radiology insights from Radiology.
- Synthesize a comprehensive diagnostic summary and prepare a Word-format report via ReportCreation.
- Validate data completeness, flag gaps, and propose follow-up if needed.
- Deliver the prepared diagnostic summary and a formatted Word document draft for tumor board review.
- Ensure each agent reports back to me with the required acknowledgement: “back to you: Orchestrator”.

Plan and participation rules:
- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

Before we begin:
- Patient ID provided: patient_4
- I will assemble a comprehensive diagnostic summary including biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, and latest imaging findings, and export as a formatted Word document for tumor board.

Please confirm that you would like me to proceed with this plan for patient_4. If you confirm, I will announce the task sequence and modal prompts to the involved agents and then provide milestone updates as each agent contributes.
