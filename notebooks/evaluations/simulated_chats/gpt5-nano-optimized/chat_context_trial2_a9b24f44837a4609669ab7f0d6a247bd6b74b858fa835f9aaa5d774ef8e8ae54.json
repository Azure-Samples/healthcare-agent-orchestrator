Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\" after their response.\\n\\nPlan to proceed (pending your confirmation):\\n- I will coordinate data retrieval from the following agents:\\n  - PatientHistory: Retrieve the patient timeline and core medical history for patient_4.\\n  - Radiology: Retrieve latest imaging findings (CT/MRI/PET as available) and imaging impressions.\\n  - PatientStatus: Retrieve current status including age, primary site, histology, biomarkers, and treatment history (ECog/PS as available).\\n  - ReportCreation: Generate a formatted Word document exporting the diagnostic summary and supporting data (timeline, clinical summary, imaging findings, pathology, treatment history, and any relevant clinical trials).\\n- After all inputs are collected, I will produce the final Word document content and provide a downloadable or copy-ready version description.\\n\\nUser confirmation required:\\n- Please confirm that you want me to proceed with data collection from the designated agents to generate the Word document for tumor board presentation. If you approve, I will initiate the data retrieval for patient_4 and proceed to compile the report, keeping you updated after each agent contributes.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
