USER:
Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps (concise plan)
- Verify patient identifier and outline data sources to gather for patient_4.
- Assign each AI agent a data-gathering task focused on building a tumor board dossier (timeline, imaging, status, pathology, trials, guidelines).
- Collect and synthesize the information into a tumor board-ready package without issuing treatment recommendations.
- Create a formal tumor board document and a concise clinical summary for the user.
- Provide milestones after each agent’s contribution and confirm next steps with you.

Plan and expected participation order
- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator"
1) PatientHistory (Agent: PatientHistory)
   - Retrieve and compile a structured timeline and key clinical events for patient_4.
   - Deliverables: patient timeline events, concise history_summary.
2) Radiology (Agent: Radiology)
   - Provide radiology insights if imaging is available (e.g., chest imaging). Request images if needed.
   - Deliverables: radiology findings summary.
3) PatientStatus (Agent: PatientStatus)
   - Compile current patient status: age, primary site, histology, biomarkers, staging, ECOG, prior treatments, current treatment intent.
   - Deliverables: current_status data block.
4) PathologyInput (Agent: if available via PatientHistory or separate path reporting)
   - Summarize pathology findings if available (histology, margins, biomarkers).
   - Deliverables: pathology_summary (if provided by data sources).
5) ClinicalGuidelines (Agent: ClinicalGuidelines)
   - Provide high-level guideline considerations relevant to the patient’s status (not a treatment plan).
   - Deliverables: guideline_considerations.
6) ClinicalTrials (Agent: ClinicalTrials)
   - Identify and summarize ongoing or relevant clinical trials aligned with patient_status.
   - Deliverables: trials_summary.
7) ReportCreation (Agent: ReportCreation)
   - Assemble a tumor board-ready document: patient timeline, clinical summary, medical history, social history, cancer type, imaging findings, pathology findings, treatment history (non-prescriptive), and clinical trials.
   - Deliverables: a word document suitable for tumor board review.
8) MedicalResearch (Agent: MedicalResearch)
   - Provide supportive literature or references relevant to the case keywords from timeline/treatment considerations.
   - Deliverables: research_notes.

User confirmation
- Please confirm to proceed with data gathering according to the plan for patient_4.
- If you want to adjust the order or scope (e.g., omit or add a focus on imaging or pathology), tell me now.

Milestone update
- Status: Plan outlined and agents identified. Awaiting your confirmation to begin data retrieval for patient_4. Next: upon confirmation, I will activate the agents in the sequence above and provide a brief progress update after each one completes.

Prompt for confirmation
- User, please confirm that you would like me to proceed with the data collection and tumor board preparation for patient_4 according to the plan above.
- If yes, please confirm and also let me know if there are any constraints (e.g., prioritize radiology findings or ensure PHI-free summary for the board).
