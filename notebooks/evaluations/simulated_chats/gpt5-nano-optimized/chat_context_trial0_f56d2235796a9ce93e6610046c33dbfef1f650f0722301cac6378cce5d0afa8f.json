Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: *Orchestrator*\\\" after their response.\\n\\nUser confirmation\\n- Please confirm that you\u2019d like me to execute this plan for patient_4. If you approve, I will start with PatientHistory and proceed in the outlined order, providing milestone updates after each step. If you want any adjustments to the plan, tell me what to change and I\u2019ll adapt.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
