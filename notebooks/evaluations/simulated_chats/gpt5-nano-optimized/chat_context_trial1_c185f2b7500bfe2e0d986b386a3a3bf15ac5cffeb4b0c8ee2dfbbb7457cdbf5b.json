Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\" after their response.\\n\\nUser confirmation:\\n- Please confirm that you\u2019d like me to proceed with the above plan to gather data from the relevant agents and assemble the tumor board package for Patient ID: patient_4. If you\u2019d like any adjustments (e.g., additional data fields to prioritize, specific formats, or emphasis on certain aspects), tell me and I\u2019ll incorporate them before we begin.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
