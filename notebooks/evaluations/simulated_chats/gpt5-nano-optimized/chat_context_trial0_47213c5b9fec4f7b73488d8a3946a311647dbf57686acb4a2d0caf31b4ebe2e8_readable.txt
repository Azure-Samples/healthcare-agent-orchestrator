USER:
Generate a comprehensive diagnostic summary for Patient ID: patient_4 including biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, and latest imaging findings. Export the report as a formatted Word document for tumor board presentation.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Moderation plan (high level, non-clinical):
- Confirm a valid patient ID is provided and ready for data retrieval.
- Retrieve the patient timeline and key data from the PatientHistory agent.
- If needed, request imaging and radiology insights from the Radiology agent (using data from the timeline).
- Synthesize a concise diagnostic summary including biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, and latest imaging findings.
- Use the ReportCreation agent to generate a formatted Word document suitable for tumor board presentation.
- Deliver the document or a download-ready payload to you, with a short status update after each major step.
- Ensure no clinical recommendations are issued; focus on documentation and organization of the diagnostic summary.

Plan for this task:
- Step 1: Retrieve patient_4’s timeline and key data from PatientHistory (biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history).
- Step 2: Obtain latest imaging findings and radiology insights as needed (via Radiology, using available timeline data).
- Step 3: Compile a comprehensive diagnostic summary with clear sections for biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, and imaging findings.
- Step 4: Generate a formatted Word document for tumor board presentation via ReportCreation.
- Step 5: Return the Word document content/attachment and a brief summary of what was produced.
- Milestone updates will be provided after each step, and each agent will return control to you with: "back to you: Orchestrator."

Important instruction:
> Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator" after their response.

User, please confirm that you’d like me to proceed with this plan to generate a comprehensive diagnostic summary for Patient ID: patient_4 and export it as a Word document for tumor board use. If you approve, I’ll initiate data retrieval from the relevant agents and keep you updated at each milestone.
