USER:
Can you scan all pathology and molecular testing to see if these biomarkers are present

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Here’s my plan to moderate this request. I’ll keep you informed at each step and only proceed when you confirm.

Moderation plan (high level)
- Confirm user intent and required identifiers: request a valid patient_id (string) and clarify whether to scan all biomarkers or target a specific list.
- Assign the right expert: engage PatientHistory to retrieve pathology and molecular testing results from the patient timeline.
- Extract biomarker data: identify all reported biomarkers in pathology reports and molecular tests.
- Summarize findings: provide a concise history summary and a structured list of biomarker results aligned to the patient timeline.
- Handle gaps: if data are missing, query for missing items or request clarifications.
- Deliver and loop back: present results in a parse-friendly format, then proceed to any additional steps or agents if needed.

Participation order
- User provides: patient_id (string) and biomarker scope (all biomarkers vs. specific list).
- Orchestrator coordinates with PatientHistory to retrieve data.
- PatientHistory returns the relevant timeline and biomarker findings.
- Orchestrator compiles and presents a concise history summary and biomarker extraction.
- If needed, we engage additional agents (e.g., MedicalResearch, ClinicalGuidelines) for further context, always returning control to the Orchestrator after each response.

Important rule to follow
> Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator" after their response.

Next step (user action required)
- User, please provide:
  1) patient_id as a string
  2) whether you want all biomarkers scanned across pathology and molecular testing, or a specific biomarker list

I’ll begin once you confirm and supply the patient_id.
