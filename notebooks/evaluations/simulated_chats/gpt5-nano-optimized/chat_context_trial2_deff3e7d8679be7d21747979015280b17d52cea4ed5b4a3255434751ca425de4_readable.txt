Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Plan and moderation steps:
- Confirm a valid patient ID and establish the tumor board objective for patient_4.
- Initiate a structured data-gathering sequence with specialized agents in a defined order.
- Collect concise, parseable inputs (timeline from History, imaging notes from Radiology, current status from Status, and then guidelines/ trials/research as needed).
- After each agent’s contribution, provide a quick progress update and identify any data gaps.
- Synthesize a tumor-board-ready summary and prepare a formal document outline (ReportCreation) if all inputs are available.
- Ensure every agent ends their response with: "back to you: Orchestrator" as required.
- Obtain user confirmation on the plan before proceeding.

Proposed participation order:
1) PatientHistory: Retrieve structured timeline and concise patient history for patient_4.
2) Radiology: Provide radiology insights and imaging findings (request images if needed; otherwise summarize available data).
3) PatientStatus: Provide current patient status (age, primary site, histology, biomarkers, treatment history, ECOG).
4) ClinicalGuidelines: Offer treatment recommendations based on patient status.
5) ReportCreation: Prepare a tumor-board-ready document outline (timeline, clinical summary, medical history, cancer type, imaging findings, pathology, treatment plan, clinical trials).
6) ClinicalTrials: Provide information on relevant clinical trials for this patient.
7) MedicalResearch: Share relevant research or evidence related to the patient’s context.

Important rule clear to all: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator" after their response.

Please confirm to proceed with this plan. If you have any adjustments or additional data you want emphasized, tell me now and I’ll incorporate them before engaging the agents. 

User confirmation requested.
