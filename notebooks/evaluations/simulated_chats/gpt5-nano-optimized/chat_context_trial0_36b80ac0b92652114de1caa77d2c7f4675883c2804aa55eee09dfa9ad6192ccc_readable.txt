Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Here is my moderation plan before we proceed:

- Confirm the patient identifier and scope: ensure Patient ID is a valid string and define the tumor-board deliverables (timeline, summary, imaging, status, guidelines, trials, and a ready-to-board document).
- Retrieve and summarize core history: pull patient timeline and concise history from PatientHistory, identify gaps, and plan data gathering from other agents.
- Gather imaging and current status: loop in Radiology for imaging insights and PatientStatus for current status (age, site, histology, biomarkers, prior treatments, performance status).
- Integrate guidance and trials: consult ClinicalGuidelines for context on standard considerations and ClinicalTrials for applicable trials.
- Compile a tumor board dossier: assemble a structured set of sections (timeline, clinical summary, imaging highlights, treatment history, cancer type, pathology, biomarkers, social history, and plan for the board) and generate a Word-like document via ReportCreation.
- Maintain a non-clinical stance: no clinical recommendations or treatment plans will be provided; we will present data and context for discussion.
- Milestones: after each agent’s input, provide a brief progress update and outline what comes next.
- Rule to follow: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (Orchestrator) with the exact phrase: "back to you: Orchestrator".

Plan and expected participation order:
1) PatientHistory: retrieve patient timeline and concise history (validate presence/structure of data, identify gaps).
2) Radiology: provide imaging insights and key findings relevant to board discussion.
3) PatientStatus: provide current patient status using data from PatientHistory (age, primary site/histology, biomarkers, ECOG, treatment history).
4) ClinicalGuidelines: summarize applicable guidelines and standard considerations based on patient status.
5) ClinicalTrials: identify relevant trials based on patient status and timeline.
6) ReportCreation: assemble a tumor-board-ready Word document containing the timeline, clinical summary, imaging, pathology if available, treatment history, social history, cancer type, ct/x-ray findings, biomarkers, planned next steps, and trials.

Special rule reminder:
> Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

Please confirm if you’d like me to proceed with this plan for Patient ID: patient_4, and if you have any adjustments to the scope or order.
