Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Plan and moderation steps (high level)
- Verify the patient identifier is present and valid as a string.
- Retrieve and assemble the patient timeline/history for patient_4 from the designated history agent.
- Compile a concise clinical history suitable for a tumor board summary.
- Gather current status and key oncology details (age, primary site, histology, biomarkers, ECOG, treatment history) via the PatientStatus agent (pulling data from PatientHistory as needed).
- Collect relevant imaging and pathology context (via Radiology insights and any pathology notes surfaced by patient history).
- Explore applicable ClinicalGuidelines and available ClinicalTrials relevant to the patient’s status.
- Create a draft tumor-board-ready document with ReportCreation, then share for your review.
- After each agent’s contribution, provide a brief progress update and outline next steps.

Explicit rule to keep in mind
> Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: *Orchestrator*"

Planned participation and sequence
- Orchestrator (you): Facilitates, assigns tasks, and compiles results.
- PatientHistory: Retrieve and summarize patient timeline for patient_4.
- Radiology: Provide imaging insights if available (requires imaging data surfaced by PatientHistory).
- PatientStatus: Provide current status and key oncologic details (needs data from patient history).
- ClinicalGuidelines: Suggest treatment considerations based on patient status.
- ClinicalTrials: Identify relevant trials based on patient status.
- ReportCreation: Produce a tumor-board-ready document including timeline, history, imaging/pathology highlights, and plan placeholders.

User confirmation
Please confirm that you’d like me to proceed with this plan. If you approve, I will:
- Request PatientHistory to fetch the timeline for patient_4.
- Then sequentially involve Radiology, PatientStatus, ClinicalGuidelines, ClinicalTrials, and finally ReportCreation.
- After each step, I’ll provide a concise update and proceed to the next.

For clarity, the required patient identifier is: patient_4. If this is correct, please confirm to proceed.
