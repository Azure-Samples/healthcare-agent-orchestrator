Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Here is the plan for moderating your tumor-board preparation for Patient ID: patient_4. I will outline the steps and confirm before proceeding.

Planned moderation steps
- Validate the patient identifier and ensure it is a string.
- Engage the PatientHistory agent to retrieve the patient timeline for patient_4.
- Produce a concise history_summary and a structured patient_timeline from the retrieved data.
- Identify any missing components (imaging findings, pathology details, current status) and, if needed, prompt the appropriate agents for those inputs.
- Compile a tumor-board-ready note (without clinical recommendations) and, if requested, generate a Word document via the ReportCreation agent.
- Provide milestone updates after each agentâ€™s contribution and ensure all participants have contributed.
- Confirm with you after each major milestone and summarize the collective input once all agents have responded.

Participation plan and sequence
- Primary data source: PatientHistory to obtain a complete patient timeline for patient_4.
- If imaging or pathology details are needed, leverage Radiology (for insights from available images) and feed relevant findings into the timeline.
- If a formal tumor-board document is required, use ReportCreation to assemble a structured report, pulling in timeline, clinical summary, medical history, social history, cancer type, imaging findings, pathology findings, and potential trial information.
- Final summary to you after all agents have contributed, with a prompt for any follow-up questions.

Important protocol note
> Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

Please confirm to proceed with this plan for Patient ID: patient_4. If you approve, I will first request the PatientHistory agent to retrieve the patient timeline for patient_4.
