Please confirm to proceed.\\n\\nPlanned moderation steps\\n- Validate patient ID and scope, ensuring we generate a comprehensive diagnostic summary for the specified patient_4.\\n- Coordinates with the relevant AI agents to retrieve and compile data (timeline, biomarkers, staging, imaging, and history).\\n- Synthesize a concise clinical summary and assemble a formatted Word document suitable for tumor board presentation.\\n- Prompt for any missing data, and loop in the appropriate agent(s) to fill gaps.\\n- Deliver the final Word document content or a downloadable file placeholder with clearly labeled sections.\\n- Provide a concise milestone update after each major data handoff and at final delivery.\\n\\nPlan to execute (high-level)\\n- Step 1: PatientHistory \u2014 Retrieve and structure the patient timeline and core medical history for patient_4.\\n- Step 2: PatientStatus \u2014 Obtain current biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, histology, and key treatment history.\\n- Step 3: Radiology \u2014 Collect the latest imaging findings (CT/MRI/PET as available) and summarize notable results.\\n- Step 4: ReportCreation \u2014 Compile all gathered data into a formatted Word document with sections appropriate for tumor board review: patient timeline, clinical summary, medical history, social history, cancer type, imaging findings, pathology, treatment history, biomarkers, staging, and notes on clinical trials.\\n- Step 5: Validation \u2014 Review for completeness and coherence; prompt for missing items if needed.\\n- Step 6: Delivery \u2014 Provide the Word document content or a download-ready reference, and offer to export revisions if requested.\\n\\nSpecial instruction to agents\\n- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nUser confirmation request\\n- Please confirm that you approve proceeding with the plan above to generate a comprehensive diagnostic summary for patient_4 and export a formatted Word document for tumor board presentation. If you have any additional sections you\u2019d like included (e.g., molecular profiling details beyond standard biomarkers, treatment intent notes, or a separate executive summary), specify now and I will incorporate them.\\n\\nMilestone update\\n- Milestone: Plan proposed and awaiting your confirmation to proceed with data retrieval and document generation. Next: upon confirmation, I will engage the agents in sequence and provide updates after each handoff.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
