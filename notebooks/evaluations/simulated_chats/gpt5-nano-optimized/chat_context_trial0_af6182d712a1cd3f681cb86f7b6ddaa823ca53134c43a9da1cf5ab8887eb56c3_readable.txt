ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Here is my brief moderation plan before proceeding:

- Confirm the exact patient identifier and the scope of data to collect (biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, latest imaging).  
- Assign data-gathering tasks to the appropriate AI agents (PatientHistory for timelines/biomarkers/staging/treatment; Radiology for imaging findings).  
- Synthesize a concise diagnostic summary from the retrieved data, highlighting biomarker status, initial stage, major treatments, and the latest imaging results.  
- Instruct ReportCreation to generate a formatted Word document suitable for tumor board presentation, incorporating the collected data and a clear clinical summary.  
- Deliver the document and a brief summary to you, and offer to adjust content or format if needed.  
- Milestone updates after each agent’s contribution to keep you informed of progress and next steps.  

Plan details and participation order:
- Participation order: PatientHistory → Radiology → ReportCreation.  
- After each agent completes their task, they must yield the chat back to you (Orchestrator). Each agent should conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator".

Special rule reminder to all participants:
> Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator" after their response.

User, please confirm the plan. If you’d like any adjustments (e.g., additional data sources or specific formatting preferences for the Word document), tell me now and I’ll incorporate them.
