Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nUser, please provide a patient_id as a string (e.g., \\\"patient-1234\\\"). Once I have the ID, I\u2019ll engage the appropriate agents to retrieve history and share a concise, non-clinical overview of potential benefits/risks and how prognosis might change with KRAS-directed therapy using adagrasib. If you\u2019d like, I can also outline questions to discuss with the treating clinician.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
