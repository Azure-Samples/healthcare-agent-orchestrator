Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\" after their response.\\n\\nUser confirmation requested:\\n- Please confirm that you approve this plan and the participation order above. If you want any changes (e.g., additional data to be included or a different sequence), say \u201cYes, adjust plan\u201d and specify the adjustments. Once you confirm, I will initiate with the first agent (PatientHistory).\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
