Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\" after their response.\\n\\nUser, please confirm whether you\u2019d like me to proceed with this plan to retrieve and assemble the tumor-board materials for patient_4. If you approve, I\u2019ll initiate with PatientHistory to fetch the timeline and proceed through the steps.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
