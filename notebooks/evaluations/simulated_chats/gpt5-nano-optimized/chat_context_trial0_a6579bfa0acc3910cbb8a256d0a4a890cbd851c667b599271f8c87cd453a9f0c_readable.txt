ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Plan for moderation and participation
- Confirm goal and required information: we need a valid patient_id (string) to retrieve timelines and history.
- Define participation order: PatientHistory first (timeline), then PatientStatus (current status), followed by ClinicalGuidelines (context for potential options) without giving treatment recommendations.
- Identify missing data: if any agent needs more details, request them from the relevant agent and then from you (the user) as needed.
- Maintain clear handoffs: after each agent responds, provide a brief progress update and what comes next.
- Ensure user understanding: summarize the collective input and outline what questions or next steps remain.
- Compliance note: do not provide clinical recommendations; coordinate information gathering and synthesis only.
- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: *Orchestrator*"
