Task \u2014 Retrieve and present patient_4\u2019s timeline and history (biomarkers, stage at diagnosis, cancer type, pathology, prior treatments, ECOG, etc.). After completion, agent will conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator.\\n- Agent: Radiology. Task \u2014 Provide latest imaging findings for patient_4 (CT/MRI/PET details, measurements, notable lesions). After completion, agent will conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator.\\n- Agent: PatientStatus. Task \u2014 Provide current status including age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, prior treatments, ECOG. After completion, agent will conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator.\\n- Agent: ReportCreation. Task \u2014 Generate a formatted Word document suitable for tumor board, using: patient timeline, clinical summary, medical history, social history, cancer type, imaging findings (CT/X-ray if applicable), pathology findings, treatment history, and clinical trials. The agent will provide the Word document file and an accessible preview. After completion, agent will conclude with: back to you: Orchestrator.\\n\\nUser confirmation needed\\n- Please confirm that you\u2019d like me to proceed with the above plan to generate a tumor-board-ready Word document for Patient ID: patient_4. If you have any additional sections you want included (e.g., family history, smoking status, allergies, performance status specifics, prior biopsy details), specify now.\\n\\nPurpose and sequence\\n- Purpose: to create a comprehensive diagnostic summary and a formatted Word document for tumor board presentation, collating biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, and latest imaging findings.\\n- Sequence: User confirmation -> PatientHistory -> Radiology -> PatientStatus -> ReportCreation -> delivery of Word document and summary.\\n\\nNote on documentation rule\\n> Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\" after their response.\\n\\nIf you confirm, I will initiate with the PatientHistory agent to pull the timeline for patient_4 and proceed step by step.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
