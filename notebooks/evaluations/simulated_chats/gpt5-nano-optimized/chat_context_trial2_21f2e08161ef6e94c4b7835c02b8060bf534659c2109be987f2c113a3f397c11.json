Please review and confirm:\\n\\n- Clarify scope: We will not provide clinical treatment plans or medical advice, but will synthesize prognosis and plausible progression pathways based on available patient data.\\n- Data orchestration: We will sequentially request and integrate data from dedicated agents (PatientHistory, Radiology, PatientStatus, MedicalResearch/ClinicalTrials as needed) to build a concise prognosis-focused report.\\n- Explicit data needs: For each agent, I will specify what details I need from them to ensure a accurate prognosis synthesis.\\n- Communication protocol: Each agent will respond with their findings and then yield back to Orchestrator with the closing line: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\".\\n- User collaboration: I will present a short prognosis draft after data synthesis and explicitly note uncertainties due to data limitations. I will prompt you for any clarifications or additional data.\\n- Milestone updates: I will provide a micro-update after each agent\u2019s contribution to describe progress and what's next.\\n- Final deliverable: A concise prognosis report with possible progression pathways, clearly labeled as such, plus a brief note on data limitations.\\n\\nPlan for participation and data flow (explicit steps):\\n- Step 1: PatientHistory \u2014 Provide patient timeline and core history for patient_id (must be a string). I will request: patient_id = \\\"patient_4\\\" is present. If needed, I\u2019ll confirm specifics like cancer type, stage, histology, biomarkers, and treatment history from the timeline.\\n  - User prompt: PatientHistory, please proceed with retrieving the timeline and key historical data for patient_4.\\n  - Expected output: structured timeline events and a concise history summary.\\n- Step 2: Radiology \u2014 Provide recent imaging findings relevant to prognosis (e.g., major lesions, metastatic sites, response on imaging).\\n  - User prompt: Radiology, please proceed with the most recent imaging interpretation for patient_4.\\n  - Expected output: imaging impressions pertinent to prognosis.\\n- Step 3: PatientStatus \u2014 Provide current status: age, staging, primary site, histology, biomarkers, prior treatments, ECOG, current status.\\n  - User prompt: PatientStatus, please proceed with current status for patient_4 derived from history and imaging.\\n  - Expected output: current status details.\\n- Step 4: MedicalResearch/ClinicalTrials \u2014 If needed, gather prognostic factors or data on progression patterns from literature or trials applicable to the cancer type and biomarkers identified.\\n  - User prompt: MedicalResearch and/or ClinicalTrials, please proceed with data on prognostic factors and progression patterns for this cancer type and biomarker profile.\\n  - Expected output: research-informed context for prognosis, without clinical treatment recommendations.\\n- Step 5: Synthesis \u2014 I, Orchestrator, will synthesize a short prognosis-focused report and plausible progression pathways from the gathered data, noting uncertainties.\\n  - User prompt: I will present the synthesized prognosis and progression pathways to you for review.\\n- Step 6: Validation \u2014 If any essential data are missing or unclear, I will request clarification or additional data from the relevant agent.\\n\\nImportant note about output structure:\\n- For successful requests, I will deliver a response including:\\n  - status: \\\"success\\\"\\n  - patient_id: \\\"patient_4\\\"\\n  - patient_timeline: [ ... structured events ... ]\\n  - history_summary: \\\"concise history\\\"\\n  - prognosis_report: not a separate field per schema, but I will embed the prognosis and progression pathways in the history_summary section as a concise narrative, clearly labeled as prognosis-based synthesis.\\n- For missing/invalid patient_id, I will respond with status: \\\"error\\\" and an explanatory error_message.\\n\\nNext step after your confirmation: I will initiate data collection from the agents in the order above and provide micro-updates after each contribution.\\n\\nUser, please confirm that you approve this plan to proceed with data gathering from the agents for patient_id: \\\"patient_4\\\". Or tell me if you\u2019d like any adjustments. \\n\\nSpecial rule reminder: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\" after their response.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
