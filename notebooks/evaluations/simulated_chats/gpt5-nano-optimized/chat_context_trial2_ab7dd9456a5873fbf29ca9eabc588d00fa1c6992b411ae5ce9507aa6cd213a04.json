Request images if needed.\\n   - Deliverables: radiology findings summary.\\n3) PatientStatus (Agent: PatientStatus)\\n   - Compile current patient status: age, primary site, histology, biomarkers, staging, ECOG, prior treatments, current treatment intent.\\n   - Deliverables: current_status data block.\\n4) PathologyInput (Agent: if available via PatientHistory or separate path reporting)\\n   - Summarize pathology findings if available (histology, margins, biomarkers).\\n   - Deliverables: pathology_summary (if provided by data sources).\\n5) ClinicalGuidelines (Agent: ClinicalGuidelines)\\n   - Provide high-level guideline considerations relevant to the patient\u2019s status (not a treatment plan).\\n   - Deliverables: guideline_considerations.\\n6) ClinicalTrials (Agent: ClinicalTrials)\\n   - Identify and summarize ongoing or relevant clinical trials aligned with patient_status.\\n   - Deliverables: trials_summary.\\n7) ReportCreation (Agent: ReportCreation)\\n   - Assemble a tumor board-ready document: patient timeline, clinical summary, medical history, social history, cancer type, imaging findings, pathology findings, treatment history (non-prescriptive), and clinical trials.\\n   - Deliverables: a word document suitable for tumor board review.\\n8) MedicalResearch (Agent: MedicalResearch)\\n   - Provide supportive literature or references relevant to the case keywords from timeline/treatment considerations.\\n   - Deliverables: research_notes.\\n\\nUser confirmation\\n- Please confirm to proceed with data gathering according to the plan for patient_4.\\n- If you want to adjust the order or scope (e.g., omit or add a focus on imaging or pathology), tell me now.\\n\\nMilestone update\\n- Status: Plan outlined and agents identified. Awaiting your confirmation to begin data retrieval for patient_4.
