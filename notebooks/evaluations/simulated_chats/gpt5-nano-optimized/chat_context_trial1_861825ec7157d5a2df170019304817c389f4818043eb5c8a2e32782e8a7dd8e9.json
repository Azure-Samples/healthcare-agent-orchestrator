After completing, yield back to Orchestrator.\\n2) PatientStatus \u2013 Provide current status details derived from the timeline (age, primary site, histology, biomarkers, ECOG, staging, treatment history). After completing, yield back to Orchestrator.\\n3) Radiology \u2013 Supply imaging insights (CT/MRI/X-ray findings, key reports) using data from the patient timeline. After completing, yield back to Orchestrator.\\n4) ReportCreation \u2013 Assemble a tumor board-ready document (timeline, clinical summary, medical/social history, cancer type, imaging findings, pathology, treatment history, and any clinical trials). After completing, yield back to Orchestrator.\\n5) ClinicalTrials (optional) \u2013 Identify nearby or relevant trials based on patient status, to be listed for discussion (not a clinical recommendation). After completing, yield back to Orchestrator.\\n6) ClinicalGuidelines (optional) \u2013 Surface guideline references for discussion only (no treatment recommendations from me). After completing, yield back to Orchestrator.\\n7) Final synthesis \u2013 Orchestrator compiles and presents a concise tumor board-ready package summary to you and outlines any data gaps or follow-up needs.\\n\\nImportant rule to follow during execution:\\n> Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\" after their response.\\n\\nPlease confirm that you would like me to proceed with this plan for Patient ID: patient_4. If you approve, I will start with the PatientHistory retrieval right away.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
