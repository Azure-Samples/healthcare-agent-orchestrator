USER:
Can you scan all pathology and molecular testing to see if these biomarkers are present

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Here is my moderation plan:
- Confirm plan and required inputs, then identify the most relevant AI agent to answer.
- Require a valid patient_id (string) to retrieve the patient's timeline and history.
- Engage PatientHistory to fetch pathology/molecular data and identify biomarker results.
- If data are missing or ambiguous, prompt the appropriate agent for specifics.
- Compile a concise biomarker presence/absence summary for the user.
- Provide a brief milestone update after each agent’s contribution and a final summary with next steps.
- Ensure no clinical recommendations are given; focus on data extraction and history summary.

Plan for your request:
- You asked to scan all pathology and molecular testing to see if these biomarkers are present. To proceed, I will fetch the patient’s pathology and molecular test data and identify which biomarkers are reported as present or absent.

Important: Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

Next step:
- Please provide a valid patient_id (as a string). If you have the specific biomarkers of interest, you can list them; otherwise I will scan for all reported biomarkers in the pathology and molecular data.

Milestone update: Once you provide the patient_id, I will request the PatientHistory agent to retrieve the relevant pathology and molecular data, then proceed to summarize biomarker status. After each agent contributes, I will give a brief progress update.
