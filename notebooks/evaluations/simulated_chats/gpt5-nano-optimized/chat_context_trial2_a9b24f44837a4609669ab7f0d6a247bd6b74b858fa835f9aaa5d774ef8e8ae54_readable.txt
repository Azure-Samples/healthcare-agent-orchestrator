USER:
Generate a comprehensive diagnostic summary for Patient ID: patient_4 including biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, and latest imaging findings. Export the report as a formatted Word document for tumor board presentation.

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Plan and moderation plan (3-7 conceptual bullets):
- Verify patient_id is valid and collect the required identifiers for data retrieval.
- Orchestrate data gathering from specialized agents (PatientHistory, Radiology, PatientStatus) to assemble a complete diagnostic picture.
- Compile a concise clinical summary focused on biomarker status, stage at diagnosis, treatment history, and latest imaging findings.
- Generate a formatted Word document suitable for tumor board presentation via ReportCreation, including all requested sections.
- Provide a summary of the collective inputs and indicate next steps or any follow-up needs.
- Ensure each agent returns content to you with the mandated “back to you: Orchestrator” conclusion and a brief milestone update.

Explicit instruction for plan:
> Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator" after their response.

Plan to proceed (pending your confirmation):
- I will coordinate data retrieval from the following agents:
  - PatientHistory: Retrieve the patient timeline and core medical history for patient_4.
  - Radiology: Retrieve latest imaging findings (CT/MRI/PET as available) and imaging impressions.
  - PatientStatus: Retrieve current status including age, primary site, histology, biomarkers, and treatment history (ECog/PS as available).
  - ReportCreation: Generate a formatted Word document exporting the diagnostic summary and supporting data (timeline, clinical summary, imaging findings, pathology, treatment history, and any relevant clinical trials).
- After all inputs are collected, I will produce the final Word document content and provide a downloadable or copy-ready version description.

User confirmation required:
- Please confirm that you want me to proceed with data collection from the designated agents to generate the Word document for tumor board presentation. If you approve, I will initiate the data retrieval for patient_4 and proceed to compile the report, keeping you updated after each agent contributes.
