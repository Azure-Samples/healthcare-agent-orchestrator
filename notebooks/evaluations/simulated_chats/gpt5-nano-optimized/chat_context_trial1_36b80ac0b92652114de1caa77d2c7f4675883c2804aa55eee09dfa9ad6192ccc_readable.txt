Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Here is my plan to moderate and prepare the tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4.

Planned moderation steps
- Validate and lock in the patient ID as the context for all activities.
- Retrieve the patient timeline and clinical history from the PatientHistory agent.
- Identify any data gaps and, if needed, request enrichment from Radiology, Pathology, or ClinicalGuidelines as appropriate.
- Synthesize a concise history_summary and a structured patient_timeline suitable for tumor board review.
- Produce tumor board-ready artifacts (clinical summary, key discussion points, and questions) and flag potential clinical questions for discussion.
- Provide milestone updates after each agent’s contribution and deliver a final collective summary.
- Ensure every agent yields back to Orchestrator after completing their task.

Plan and expected participation sequence
- User confirms plan.
- Orchestrator instructs: PatientHistory, please proceed with retrieving the patient_timeline and history for patient_4.
- After PatientHistory responds, Orchestrator will summarize and, if needed, engage Radiology and Pathology for imaging/pathology details.
- After all agents contribute, Orchestrator provides a consolidated tumor board-ready summary and discussion points.

Explicit rule to remember
> Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (the Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: *Orchestrator*"

User confirmation
- Please confirm that you approve this plan to proceed with obtaining and compiling the patient timeline and tumor board materials for patient_4. If you’d like any adjustments to the plan, tell me what to change and I’ll adapt.

If you confirm, I will immediately engage the PatientHistory agent to retrieve the patient timeline for patient_4 and proceed with the outlined workflow.
