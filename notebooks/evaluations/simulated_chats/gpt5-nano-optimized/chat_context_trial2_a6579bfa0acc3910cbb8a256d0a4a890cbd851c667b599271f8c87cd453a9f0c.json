Instruct each agent to conclude with: \\\"back to you: Orchestrator\\\"\\n\\nPlan to proceed:\\n- I will require a valid patient_id string to begin. Once you provide it, I will coordinate the following flow:\\n  - PatientHistory: assemble a concise patient timeline using the ID.\\n  - PatientStatus: extract current status (age, cancer type/site, biomarkers including KRAS G12C status, histology, ECOG, prior treatments).\\n  - ClinicalGuidelines: review current guidance related to KRAS G12C-directed therapy (adagrasib) for the patient\u2019s context.\\n  - Synthesize findings into a brief, non-prescriptive summary of potential benefits/risks and how this class of therapy might influence prognosis in general terms.\\n- After each agent\u2019s contribution, I\u2019ll give a micro-update and return control to me.\\n\\nRegarding general context (non-patient-specific, for orientation):\\n- Adagrasib is a KRAS G12C inhibitor studied in KRAS G12C-mutant cancers (notably NSCLC) and has been evaluated in patients who have received prior therapy. General potential benefits reported in trials include evidence of tumor response and disease stabilization in a subset of patients, with responses sometimes lasting several months. Real-world benefits vary by tumor type, prior therapies, and molecular/clinical factors.\\n- Common risks/side effects observed with KRAS G12C inhibitors in trials include gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting), fatigue, decreased appetite, liver enzyme elevations (hepatotoxicity), edema, and rarely inflammatory lung effects such as pneumonitis/ILD. Monitoring for liver function and respiratory symptoms is typically important. Drug interactions and adherence considerations may apply.\\n- Impact on prognosis is context-dependent. In trial settings, meaningful responses and progression-free intervals have been observed in some patients, but outcomes are heterogeneous and depend on line of therapy, tumor biology, co-mutations, and how the disease behaves with targeted therapy. This is not a guaranteed improvement and should be discussed in the context of the patient\u2019s overall disease status and goals of care.\\n\\nNow, please provide a valid patient_id as a string so I can begin. \\n- User, please share the patient_id string. If you prefer not to share identifiers, I can still provide general information, but I won\u2019t be able to tailor it to a specific history. \\n\\nMilestone update: Plan articulated and awaiting a valid patient_id to start data retrieval and agent-specific responses. Next: once you provide the ID, I will engage the relevant agents in order and report back after each contribution.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
