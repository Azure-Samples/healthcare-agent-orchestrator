Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Plan and moderation plan (before proceeding)
- Confirm a valid patient ID and initialize the data-gathering process.
- Retrieve the structured patient timeline from PatientHistory for patient_4.
- Derive current status and key clinical details (status, staging, histology, biomarkers, ECOG) using PatientStatus informed by the timeline.
- Gather imaging insights from Radiology (CT/MRI/X-ray) if available, and integrate findings.
- Collect pathology and treatment history data to support a tumor-board-ready clinical summary.
- Engage ClinicalGuidelines and ClinicalTrials to provide context and potential implications, then generate a tumor-board-ready document via ReportCreation.
- Provide concise milestone updates after each agentâ€™s contribution and a final summary. 
- Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator"

User, please confirm that you want me to proceed with this plan for Patient ID: patient_4. Upon your confirmation, I will initiate with the PatientHistory agent to retrieve the timeline.
