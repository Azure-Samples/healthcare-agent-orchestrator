Prepare tumor board for Patient ID: patient_4

---

ASSISTANT (agent id: Orchestrator):
Planned moderation steps:
- Confirm patient ID validity and scope for tumor-board preparation.
- Request and obtain structured patient timeline and history from the PatientHistory agent.
- Identify and engage additional agents (Radiology, PatientStatus, ClinicalGuidelines, ReportCreation, ClinicalTrials, MedicalResearch) as needed to assemble a comprehensive board-ready summary.
- Synthesize a concise history summary and a structured timeline suitable for review, noting any gaps to resolve.
- Provide milestone updates after each agent’s input and ensure all agents have contributed before finalizing.
- Present the final summary to you and offer next steps or questions for further refinement.

Plan for action (with required participation order):
1) PatientHistory: Retrieve patient timeline data for patient_4 and provide a concise history summary.
2) If needed, involve Radiology and Pathology for imaging/pathology highlights.
3) PatientStatus: Confirm current status and key clinical details (age, site, histology, biomarkers, ECOG, prior treatments) from the PatientHistory data.
4) ClinicalGuidelines: Outline non-treatment-specific considerations or standard-of-care framework to contextualize the board notes (without prescribing treatment).
5) ReportCreation: Generate a tumor-board-ready document outline (timeline, clinical summary, medical history, social history, cancer type, imaging findings, pathology, treatment history, trial options).
6) ClinicalTrials and MedicalResearch: Provide relevant trial options and research context as applicable.
7) Synthesize final board-ready summary and present to you.

Important rule to follow:
> Each agent, after completing their task, must yield the chat back to you (Orchestrator). Instruct each agent to conclude with: "back to you: Orchestrator" after their response.

User, please confirm whether you’d like me to proceed with this plan to retrieve and assemble the tumor-board materials for patient_4. If you approve, I’ll initiate with PatientHistory to fetch the timeline and proceed through the steps.
