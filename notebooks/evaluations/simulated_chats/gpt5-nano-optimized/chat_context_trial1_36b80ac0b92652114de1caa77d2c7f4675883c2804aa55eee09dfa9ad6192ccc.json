If you\u2019d like any adjustments to the plan, tell me what to change and I\u2019ll adapt.\\n\\nIf you confirm, I will immediately engage the PatientHistory agent to retrieve the patient timeline for patient_4 and proceed with the outlined workflow.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
